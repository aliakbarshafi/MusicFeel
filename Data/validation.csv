And how his drinking had ruined their lives

For you see folks it was him lying drunk there in that gutter
Clutching in his little own hand, the letter that Johnny Walker read

I stayed a wake 'cuz my nightmares of seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tire peelin' after leavin' him lead

Regular gettin' money nigga but love to clown a lot
Walked across the park stuntin' frontin'
Diamond in his hear diamond watch on
Eatin' a bag of popcorn

Walked up behind this shorty grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away, so he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't except it
Called him a pussy, told him she be back in a second

He didn't pay her no mind called her bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park wit no niggas wit him and no nine
Then in no time older nigga from behind swung a baseball bat
Left his face all cracked told him take all that
Hit him again popped his chain wit a frown
And left the clown wit a stain on the ground

I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it

So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode and
Have another episode where I let it go
As far as the one with Benzino did

I'm waitin' for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fuckin' pole vault with

Oh, shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name, it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame

Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy, buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp

They after that Shady, aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally
Understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other?
In time we discovered that we have more in common
Then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers

Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
'Cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers
Who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives, he's gettin' dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'
Even if I'm under the gun

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit

Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual
Ego's aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nike's, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats

Stompin', I been rompin'
Since Tim Dogg was hollerin' 'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin' Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet

That tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit

To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher

Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when
I ended up this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel dissin' again
So I decided just to pick this pen

Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I can't just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others' eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room

Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like

Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help

Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that

'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different

I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you

So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you

Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon

Down And Out In Paradise
Dear Mr. President
I live in the suburbs
It's a long way from Washington, D.C.
Had me a job
Workin' for wages
Till the company moved out
And they forgot about me
Can't draw unemployment
For some unknown reason
My kids are hungry
I've got four mouths to feed
I go out everyday lookin' for suitable employment
Do you think there's something you could do for me
Cause I'm

Down and out and I'm on my knees
I'm down and out here in paradise
Looks like the milk and honey
Done run out on me

Dear Mr. President
I used to be a dancer
Got a little bit too old
So I became a secretary
Married a man
In Las Vegas, Nevada
And ten years later
He ran out on the kids and me
Some said I was pretty
But those days are over
Now I've no place to live
And I'm out on the streets
Oh, Mr. President
Can I tell you a secret
I never ever thought that his could happen to me
Cause I'm

Dear Mr. President

I'm in the fourth grade
At Riley Elementary
My mom and dad's been actin' funny
I'm not sure what
If it ain't got something to do with me
My daddy's always drunk
My mom's a babysitter
And I don't like the Russians
Cause I hear they hate me
Dear Mr. President
Can I ask you one question
When the bombs fall down
Will they hurt everyone in my family
Yeah, yeah

The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
In a minute or less when I called to confess and make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ahh oooh
Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Answer the question
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you
Did you get my message, sugar now
I did not hear one thing you sent to me
Did you get my message, love
