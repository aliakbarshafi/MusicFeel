You Are
This broken wheel is coming undone.

Leading me higher. When you let me in.

Keeping us close, so close, on down the line.
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun with no one knowing.
But you're keeping me strong. Moving along with you.

Stagger Lee

It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards
Stagger Lee 
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
Stagger Lee 
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, ""Never ever come back no more""
Stagger Lee 
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee 
He said ""Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am""
The barkeeper said, ""No, and I don't give a good goddamn""
To Stagger Lee 
He said, ""Well bartender, it's plain to see
I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee""
Mr. Stagger Lee 
Barkeep said, ""Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day""
Mr Stagger Lee 
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said
'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head 
Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town 
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt
With Stagger Lee 
She saw the barkeep, said, ""O God, he can't be dead!""
Stag said, ""Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head"" 
She said, ""You ain't look like you scored in quite a time.
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime""
Mr. Stagger Lee 
""But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,
Mr. Stagger Lee"" 
""I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass""
Said Stagger Lee 
""I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole""
Said Stagger Lee 
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, ""You must be
That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee""
Stagger Lee 
""Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead""

The spotlights here can burn holes through the staaage
Down to the basement pass the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through shinin', nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, 'less it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaaaze, woo!
Now that's important to say
'Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to faaade
We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to staaay
Like the Governor called and he told him to waaait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his caaage
The audience ain't faaazed
And they ain't gon' clap and they ain't gon' praise
They want everything back that they've paid
'Cause they've been waitin' since ten to see the lights get dim

[Chorus? Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show oh oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 3? Lupe Fiasco]
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standin' in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting' along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are grown, M&amp;Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performin' for me
Like, ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha, ha

[Chorus? Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphone's
And they wanna' know oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar

You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent

And you pick out all clothes by using your nose
It was the rush hour when I was on the train
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death
I couldn't hold a conversation, I was holding my breath
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air
Was homeboy sittin' next to me, I swear!
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming

Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon
The crowd was on the floor, rocking the beat
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week
The smell was all through the house, cold rockin' the place
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm
A girl said ""Look, there's Monster growin under his arm""
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh)
And they declared his arm public enemy number one

TRBGXHJ128F93302C7.h5,FFH,Listen,2005,"Voices are everywhere, and they’re screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me. We’ve got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times. You can’t do it. You can’t do it on your own. You’re not smart enough. You’re not strong enough. You’re not stable enough. You’re not thin enough. And then there’s the enemy. The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you’ll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago. He’s a great man. I love him so much. And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him. My dad had just put a room onto his house. And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad’s work. And he got done and went to my dad, and said, “That’s a good job Harry.” And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice. Without hearing that, whether it’s the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don’t have any identity. You have no way to function. I think Jesus knew that. I think that’s why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people. He never asked them to be anything that they weren’t. He tried to get them to understand who they were. That’s why he said, “You’re my daughter, you’re my son, you’re my brother, you’re my sheep.” He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we’re His creation; that we're worth something.

Yeah, and that’s something amazing about Jesus. He could look down into somebody’s spirit and draw out who they really were. I mean, he looked at Simon and said, “You know what? You’re not Simon, You’re Peter. You’re a Rock.”

And how ‘bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, “Daughter.” His first word: Daughter.

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father. Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke. I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn’t inward. Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it. Like at His baptism, God the father said, “you are my son, I love you and I’m pleased with you.” And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it. The father said, “You are my son. I have chosen you, and God just established Christ’s purpose on that mountain.” And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour? No. This is why I’ve come. Glorify your name father. And the father spoke and said, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross.

I think it did too. You may have never heard that voice. That voice that says you’re worth it. You’re smart enough. I believe in you. I love you. There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it’s just a vacuum. Listen, Jesus doesn’t require anything of you. You can’t work to get His approval. Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, “This is my son who I love.” Jesus hadn’t done a single miracle. All he asks of you is that you listen.",sad

turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

I was feeling kinda seasick
but the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder

as the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray
And so it was that later
as the miller told his tale

that her face, at first just ghostly,
turned a whiter shade of pale
She said, 'There is no reason

and the truth is plain to see.'
But I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might have just as well've been closed

She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
though in truth we were at sea

so I took her by the looking glass
and forced her to agree
saying, 'You must be the mermaid
who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly

that my anger straightway died
If music be the food of love
then laughter is its queen
and likewise if behind is in front
then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
and attacked the ocean bed",happy

In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.

And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon,
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Is that it sings for you and I
