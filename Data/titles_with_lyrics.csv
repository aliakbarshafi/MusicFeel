Just to test her 'cause I ain't no jester

I go crazy in the clutch

Strange things for the [Incomprehensible] denim no matter who's in em

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

At night I feel the end it is at hand

Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

She makes a man want to speak Spanish

Bonita? Si

You make a woman go mad

Have come to feel me, feel me

from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'pac carried
crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club, Jay-Z
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Boo-boop-so-boop, no more dooby snack groups

Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must i say in this letter i pray
Tell mommy i miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon i hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To god up in heaven you'll get it i hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go

Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end

Stain the milky sunset red

But what are we here for?

What are we here for? 
Have we been through everything,

Travelling through the darkness, 
guided by the light that shines on everyone. 
Each of us an island,

Have we been through everything,

So many of our dreams are telling us just who we are, 
where we're from and how we came so far. 
If we would only listen to the things within we know are true, 
then all of us would see a brighter day.

With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge

Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks

Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin

And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg

Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg

like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

To the land where the Bong-Tree grows
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose,
With a ring at the end of his nose.

""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,

They danced by the light of the moon."

Fuck, who was that? All this shit is freaking me
It is I God, did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane
You are talking to yourself, we are one and the same
It can't be, it must be the drugs, I'm high
And if You are then why are we born if we live to die?

Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin, is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong, did you write the ten commandments?

Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there's no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?

The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you, yes, there is life in other planets

The future's a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift, that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise will understand this and the clever will use it

Yes, but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity
I can't think, I feel life going down the drain
In the streets, everywhere I am surround in pain

Don't think, your thoughts are just that thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul, the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?

How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of them self to manifest

But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God, dammit then show me the light
And tell me, what's the meaning of life?
The process of all life is an ongoing

Never-ending process of recreation of self
Is God a He or She is there one true religion?
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the Beginning and Ending
We are all one and everything is living

Words that no longer rhyme
Days spent in your room
Spinning webs with the threads left of your mind
Dreams you no longer face
Hidden away in some far place
A shame of a kind that does not erase
Hold onto your pillow and drop out of the race

Blindfolded, stumbling across a tightwire
Shot down in a steep climb

TRACBLO128E0784286.h5,Spinal Tap,The Majesty Of Rock,1992,"There's a pulse in the new-born sun
A beat in the heat of the noon
There's a song as the day grows long
And a tempo in the tides of the moon
It's all around us and it's everywhere
And it's deeper than royal blue
And it feels so real you can feel the feeling

And that's the majesty of rock
The fantasy of roll
The ticking of the clock
The wailing of the soul
The prisoner in the dock
The digger in the hole
We're in this together... and ever...

In the shade of a jungle glade
Or the rush of the crushing street
On the plain, on the foamy main
You can never escape from the beat
It's in the mud and it's in your blood
And it's conquest is complete
And all that you can do is just surrender

To the majesty of rock
The pageantry of roll
The crowing of the cock
The running of the foal
The shepherd with his flock
The miner with his coal
We're in this together... and ever...

When we die, do we hunt the sky?
Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?
What then? Are we born again?
Just to sit asking questions like these?
I know, for I told me so
And I'm sure each of you quite agrees
The more it stays the same, the less it changes

And that's the majesty of rock
The mystery of roll
The darning of the sock
The scoring of the goal
The farmer takes a wife
The barber takes a pole
We're in this together... and ever..."

Feathered hair

The moon don't know if it's day or night
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes
You're making coffee for everyone concerned
Someone points to this and someone points to that
Everyone is saying that you should lie down
But you ain't having none of that
And I say to the sleepy summer rain
With a complete absence of pain
You might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Hide your eyes, hide your tears,
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you"

TRACHTO12903CBE58B.h5,The Animals_ Sonny Boy Williamson,Bo Diddley,1973,"Now let's hear the story of Bo Diddley
And the rock 'n' roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom
Mississipi about 1926
He moved to Chicago about 1938
Where his name was eventually changed
To Bo Diddley
He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night
Till his papa's hair began to turn white
His pa said, ""Son, listen hear, I know
You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go""
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
Headed out for them western skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there, everybody raving
One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights
Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar
Said, ""C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star""
Bo Diddley said, ""Uh, what's in it for me?""
Man said, ""Shut your mouth son
Play the guitar and you just wait and see""
Well, that boy made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the rock 'n' roll scene along with him
And a white guy called Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm
He changed it into handjive and it went like this
In a little old country town one day
A little old country band began to play
Add two guitars and a beat up saxophone
When the drummer said, ""Boy, those cats begin to roam""
Oh, baby oh we oh oh
Ooh, la la that rock 'n' roll
Ya, hear me oh we oh oh
Ooh, la la that rock 'n' roll
Then in the U.S. music scene there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control, such as payola
The rock 'n' roll scene died after two years of solid rock
And you got discs like ah
""Take good care of my baby,
About, ah, one year later in a place called Liverpool in England
Four young guys with mop haircuts began to sing stuff like, ah
""It's been a hard days night and I've been workin' like a dog"", and so on
In a place called Richmond in Surrey, way down in the deep south
They got guys with long hair down their back singin'
""I wanna be your lover baby, I wanna be your man yeah"", and all that jazz
Now we've doin' this number, Bo Diddley, for quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
We were playin' at the club a Gogo in Newcastle, our home town
And the doors opened one night and to our surprise
Walked in the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was Jerome Green, his Maraca man
And the Duchess, his gorgeous sister
And a we were doin', doin' this number
Along with them came the Rolling Stones, the Mersey Beats
They're all standin' around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'
He turned around to Jermone Green
And he said, ""Hey, Jerome
What do you think these guys doin' our, our material?""
Jerome said, ""Uh, where's the bar man, please show me to the bar""
He turned around the Duchess
And he said, ""Hey Duchess
What do you think of these young guys doin' our material?""
She said, ""I don't know
I only came across here to see
The changin' of the guards and all that jazz""
Well, Bo Diddley looked up at me and he said
With half closed eyes and a smile
He said, ""Man, took off his glasses""
He said, ""Man, that sure is the biggest load of rubbish
I ever heard in my life""
Hey, Bo Diddley
Oh, Bo Diddley
Yeah, Bo Diddley

(For amusement, ah)
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now, I've been licking my wounds
(Licking my wounds)
But the venom seems deeper
  (Deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce, but darling you hold me prisoner

Ohh, I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure, and I'm fiending for a cure
Ohh, every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need
Oh, I can't mend this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return, what did I do to deserve?
The pain of this slow burn, and everywhere I turn
I keep going right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from
Yea, yea
  (I need to get away from you, need to walk away from you)

Every time I try to grasp for air
I am smothered in despair
It's never over, over, ohh ohh
It seems I'll never wake from this nightmare
I let out a silent prayer
Let it be over, over, ooh
Ohh, inside I'm screaming, begging, pleading no more
  (Ooh ooh)
Now what to do, my heart ache's been bruised
So sad but it's true, each beat reminds me of you

And everywhere I turn, I keep going right back

Sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

Across the North and South, to Key Largo, love for sale

Yet need the chase

A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold

Called him a pussy, told him she be back in a second

He didn't pay her no mind called her bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park wit no niggas wit him and no nine
Then in no time older nigga from behind swung a baseball bat
Left his face all cracked told him take all that

Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon,
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --

The vision laid close

""There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...""

With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,

On top of the stairways

Time to move on

Paint the walls dark red with blood and bone spackles.
Knocked the next one off the C block balcany,
I snatched his tazor gun, home free I'm about to be.
Made a run for the door I didn't look back
I got shot in the back of my head and...

Why I'ma, be hateful if I could care
Why would I hate my own, and forsake my home
Why would I fuck around and get a jake my chrome

Ready for the revolution at the drop of a dime

My duty to serve the beautiful black sisters
A duty to stand with anybody that's with us
And fully criticize all bullshitters
There should be awards presented, to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sisters who like gats

Recognize any soldier that's doin the same

Rather deal with the truth than falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and
Claimin it's all good

Put food on the table at whatever the price

When there ain't no meat, she bless me with the eggs and the rice
Never think twice, I love you for the rest of my life

Si es que te vas

Y no alimentes la esperanza, 
de encontrar viejos caminos 
que ya nunca he de pasar. 
Si es que te vas, 
habrá un ""te quiero"" 
ya lo sé, de soledad. 
no habrá recuerdo amargo 
en cada luego despertar. 
Y entre mi manos las caricias
duermen ya.

Si es que te vas 
no habrá un reproche que te impida realizar 
la voluntad omnipotente de encontrar
aquel destino que marcó tu corazón.

(Estribillo 2:) 
Por eso, si es que te vas
no te preocupes, no hay condena
si hay alguien más 
podrás decirlo aunque me duela. 
Si esa es la verdad,
solo te pido que no vuelvas nunca más.

Si es que te vas 
voy a abrazarte
con la angustia del que da
todo por nada y es más triste llorar
Ya ves, prefiero abrir mis brazos
verte andar.

Si es que te vas 
caen las lágrimas
rodándome en la piel.
El frío intenso de saber 
que pronto no estarás
para el amor de nuestro mundo
nunca más.

To be willing to compromise

Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully

To leave me alone when you freaks see me out

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song
'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
(Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up

When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is""

And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
(Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk

With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
(Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who what when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
(Drivin' me crazy)
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

Supposed to last forever
So why do promises just simply fly away
Though love has passed me by
And left me alone and crying
I still believe that love will come
Along one day

If I have to search forever to find
Where love begins
I'm not exactly sure
Where I should start
But I still believe with all my soul
And heart, when it tells me ...

Chorus:
Somewhere, just beyond the reach
Of my arms
You're waiting there
Somehow, I'll find my way
Into your heart
I will search everywhere
You know they say that you can't
Ever go back again. But I say
Where there's a love, there's a way
'Till I find you somewhere ...
Somehow ... someway

Don't bother talkin' to me. There
Words just go right through me
You see, I've been there and I've
Heard it all before
If miracles are only ... a matter
Of believing
I can't help wondering who
Those miracles are for

Yeah, they say there's always
Someone for everyone, it seems
But surely that means everyone but me
Still there's a part of me that's dying
To believe ... believe that

Someday - God only knows how
Long it's gonna take
Somehow - I still believe that love
Will find a way
Somewhere - where you and I will
Chance to meet one day
We're living for that moment ... Real
Love is worth the wait"

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time, oh yeah

And charity is a coat
You wear twice a year

And you find that what was over there
Is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Didn't you cover your eyes when they told you?
That he can't come back

Breathe your life into me and cure my disease
Open the window. The center of your chest
Take an axe to the glass. Find a friend and hide
I've built a home for my sweet across the brooding sea
Every cut that I made, I thought of your face
And every stone that was laid made your image cease to fade
But alas I am scorned. Hereby sentenced henceforth to wander
In empty castles
Body is a device to calculate
Soul is the earth trodden under our feet
Mind is the beauty begging to be raped
God is a child tugging on the shirt tails of fate
The snake is charming us
Our voices will ring from skyscrapers down the ley lines

You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of it's meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

Tu pasión violenta me tragó
Hasta lo más íntimo
Como una oleada

Y me dejó la piel marcada.

La marca de tus labios
Vi sobre mi amor desgarrador
Un signo extraño.

De un beso solitario
Vi sobre mi amor ese color

Coming out soft from the windows above

Cut all the lines so the phones donâ€™t ring

Watching the ice melt the mornings sing

Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrol men

Torture, blood flow like bodies of water
Fathers sexually assaultin' they own daughter
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle

In a game of life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms, ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left

Peep the imagery strep, across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
Time to set it off, let's spark this
Switzerland, let's spark this

We are the ultimate

Yo my definition is the lyricist for hire
You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire
The books I buy live arms I acquire
The Fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir

We explore the whole states plus record
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard

To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes
I said, ""I don't got 'em"", Guess it kinda presented a problem
When I understood, they said, ""Let him go""
I woke up, though we descended to London, Heathrow

And now with a past, fuckin' with border patrol
I'm findin' it out, I'm leakin' with my people
Hit the studio, spread this information
In daze of frustration fogged the education

From Illa-Fifth to Switzerland destination
The Roots du journ, go check the translation
The dictionary of devout topics, far from Ebonics
The Fifth Dynast, they can't stop it, yo Zurlich y'all keep it tight heed
While The Roots Crew smoke weed

Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room

Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like

Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find

With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help

Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that

'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different

I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find

Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon

And to the rest of the world

Happening all of the time

Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties when all's said and done

Moving along in our God given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door

Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drop by the beach

Another time, another place.
The lonely streets where we embraced.
Then you would go without a trace.
Nothing's the same without you.

Another day goes passing by.
I sit alone and wonder why.
Sometimes it's hard, but I will try
to live my life without you.

You're in my heart, you're in my dreams.
You're everywhere or so it seems.
So many times I've heard that song.
Hold back the tears, pretend you're strong.

Another day goes slowly by.
I sit alone and wonder why.
I think of you, I start to cry.
Nothing's the same without you.

Another time, another place.
The sweetness of our last embrace.
What would I give to see your face.
Nothing's the same without you.

And the comfort of your smile.

I'm waiting for someone to just wake me up,
From this life.

As I look out at these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart.
I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best.
And the hard times,
They only made us stronger.

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm suppose to carry on when you're gone.
I'll never be the same without you, 
I love you more then you will ever know.
So maybe now you finally know.
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can let it keep you weighted down.
You must go on.

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky,
I say this prayer for you tonight,
Because nothing is impossible.

se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar:
""Caminante no hay camino,
se hace camino al andar...""

Golpe a golpe, verso a verso...

Murió el poeta lejos del hogar.
Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino.
Al alejarse, le vieron llorar.
""Caminante no hay camino,
se hace camino al andar...""

Golpe a golpe, verso a verso...

Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar.
Cuando el poeta es un peregrino,
cuando de nada nos sirve rezar.
""Caminante no hay camino,
se hace camino al andar...""

Golpe a golpe, verso a verso."

Fall around into the ground
Deep down far as you can

Go out tonight and meet the dawn again

Learn to accept the things I am
Never liked myself before now even less

When it rains it pours
Down my hard head forevermore, forever
Into the ground deep down far as you can
Who was I kidding? Who was I kidding?

You've gained some weight
And all you can think is
When the Romeo's gonna show

And I believe it's what it made me to be
Revolutionary slave to my hated beliefs

Stand on my own two, no one said it'd be easy
Just keep it moving, feet where the streets be

No surrender or truce

Legend in my own right

We destined to burst from underground soul in the dirt
Straight to the top we headed leaving devils beheaded
On the world that's filled with controversy, thoughts are embedded
Of violent action, racism, you see it on the news
And listen brainwashing the masses through subliminal television
It's sick, that's why I say the government can eat a dick
They don't help me the slightest bit when I need it
So fuck em, I live my own life, I blaze my own trail
Do a little dirt, get locked up, I pay my own bail

Survivals of the struggle, march through Hell puffing blunts
Dodging pitchforks, at war on the darkest levels

From a six and a mansion to beating the sands

Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key

A temporary place to hide

hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness
Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me

Kurt, Krist and Dave began rehearsing. - ST THOMAS

""We'd been, um, practicing in this really weird practice space. This man
built a studio in this like barn in his backyard, but it wasn't
a barn, it was this thing that had a studio in it, and then upstairs his
brother lived up there, and he was in this really bad like Howard
Johnson's lounge band. Everything is carpeted with this like brown
shag carpet, and he even had stage lights in there and he had a
massive PA that he just did not know how to use, and he'd turn it on,
and 'SHHHHHHHHH' there's just this huge hiss, and we were practicing a
lot and we were writing a lot of material. We'd write them, they were
great for like 2 weeks, 'Oh my God, this is the best song ever' and we'd
forget them, and so then we decided 'OK, well we'll start putting them on
cassette' so we started recording them onto these boom box things,
and we'd lose the cassettes y'know, so I mean we wrote so much material, that
we just like, forgot about and every once in a while we'll just like,
pull one out and turn it around."" - DAVE

While the band was writing and rehearsing, the major labels started
taking interest. - ST THOMAS

""They were wining and dining us, and there were some labels that we were
impressed by them, but uh, we thought uh DGC would be the best for us.""

Was one of the main reasons because of Sonic Youth? - ST THOMAS

""Yeah, we knew Sonic Youth were happy on there, and we've always loved and
respected Sonic Youth, so and there's like all these rumors, that we got like
a million dollars, or 700, it was actually, even in Spin Magazine it was
printed that, that we got $750, 000, and we didn't even get a quarter of
that. What we did was instead of going for the big dough we went for the
strong contract.""

Which enables you like more freedom and - ST THOMAS

""More freedom, uh, more percentage points on the record, and there's a lot of
clauses in there that are in our favor. Now if our record would've
bombed, we woulda kicked ourselves in the butt and said 'Maaan, we
should've took the cash!', but were not in it for the money, we were in
it for y'know, let's put out a record and let's do this thing right""
- KRIST

snippet of Lithium

""I really don't know what the definition of selling out is anymore, I
guess I really don't care. We haven't compromised, our record label
let's us do anything we want we think on the same level, there's nothing
that we've done, that could be considered a sell out at all, at least
not in my eyes. A lot of people were calling us sell out, they forget
that y'know, the Ramones, and the Sex Pistols were on major labels, so
was the Clash, and they all, all those bands were trying to become big
stars they didn't even deny it. Crap, the Ramones even had a movie out
after them, y'know, to help support them."" - KURT

""Y'know I think that if you make money and you start voting Republican
because you'll get tax breaks, and they're the party of the rich, I mean
- that's sold out."" - KRIST

In early 1991 Nirvana entered the studio with producer Butch Vig. - ST
THOMAS

""Yeah, we worked with him in the spring time, when we, when we did that
demo, that I mentioned earlier. He was just easy to work with laid back,
and um, really attentive to what's going on. He works hard, but he
doesn't work the band hard."" - KRIST

""It was about time that the band recorded something, finally, it had
been so long."" - DAVE

""It was called Sound City, and the board and the room were really old,
the board was from the early 70's"" - KURT

""All the dinosaurs have recorded there, uh, Fleetwood Mac, uh, Cheap
Trick"" - KRIST

""There's nothing more disgusting, than the late 80's or early 90's slick
sound, y'know, you just can't escape it, no matter how retro and old you
try to be, or what kind of old equipment you use, you still can't help
but sound new."" - KURT

""We got a warm sound outta that place"" - KRIST

""It'd been two years since Bleach, it'd been awhile, since the band
had gone in and recorded a full LP, so it was more of like, 'wow, ok,
we're in the studio, let's just get this done! Let's just do it!'"" - DAVE

""We made the record we wanted to make, we didn't have any, we didn't
wanna make the number one record, we didn't want to make some big hit
record, it's, y'know that's, it woulda been the same record if it was on
Sub Pop."" - KRIST

Live version of Drain You

That's Drain You recorded live. Kurt and Dave talk about writing songs - ST
THOMAS

""It's usually done on an acoustic guitar sitting around in my underwear, just
picking out riffs, pieces of songs."" - KURT

""Maybe Kurt'll come in with a melody, a guitar riff, and um, show it to
us."" - DAVE

""We go to practice and then we play the song over, and over and over again.""
- KURT

""We just jam! There's no real formula."" - DAVE

""Krist and Dave have a big part in deciding on how long a song should
be, and how many parts it should have, so, I don't like to be considered
as the whole song writer, but I do come up with the basis of it. I come
up with the singing style during practice and then I write the lyrics usually
minutes before we record."" - KURT

(Referring to Something In The Way)

""That song really wasn't even written until a week before we went into
the studio. And uh, I knew I wanted cello on it, but after all the music
was recorded for it, we'd kinda forgotten about putting a cello on it,
and we had one more day in the studio, and we decided 'Oh, geez, we
should try to hire a cellist' y'know, and put something in, and we were
at a party, and we were asking some of our friends if they had any
friends who play cello, and it just so happened that one of our best

they're kind of a rebuttal, to each line, and they're just kinda confusing I

(Referring to Polly)

""Just because I say 'I' in a song doesn't necessarily mean it's me. A
lot of people have a problem with that. It's just the way I write
usually, take on someone else's personality or character. I'd rather
just use someone else's example, because I dunno, my life is kinda
boring, and so y'know, I just take stories from things I've read, and
off the television, and in stories I've heard, maybe even some friends.""

""This friend of mine and I were goofing around in my house one night, and we
were kinda drunk, and we were writing graffiti all over the walls of my
house, and she wrote 'Kurt smells like teen spirit'. And earlier on, we were
kinda having this discussion on revolution, and teen revolution and stuff
like that, and I took that as a compliment, I thought that she was saying
that I was a person who, who could inspire. I just thought that was a nice
little title. And it turns out she just meant that I smelt like the
deodorant. I didn't even know that deodorant existed,
until after the song was written."" - KURT

""My father said this to me 'I know why you guys've sold so many

really, I don't see it that way, I mean, like, I don't want to hold a
responsibility of being a spokesman for anything! You know I can barely hold
my own! I guess it's flattering, and I guess it's great that it acts like

That's On A Plain recorded live. Kurt talks about the artwork on Nevermind. -
ST THOMAS

""One day, Dave and I were sitting around watching a documentary on
babies being born underwater .and um, I thought that was a really neat
image, so we thought, 'Let's put that on the album cover', and then when
we got back a picture of a baby underwater, we thought, I thought it
would look nice for a fish with a dollar bill on it and so, the
image was born."" - KURT

(Referring to photograph on the back of the Nevermind album cover)

""It's just a rubber monkey, that I've had for years, and I took that
picture. It was in a Bohemian photography stage y'know, taking a bunch
of weird, arty pictures, and that's one of them"" - KURT

""It's a collage that I made many years ago. I, I got these pictures of
beef, from a supermarket poster, and cut them out, and made a mountain
of beef and then put Dante's people being thrown into hell climbing all
over it, and um, that's pretty much, yeah, there's also, if you look
real close, there's a picture of Kiss, in the back standing on a slab
of beef"" - KURT

""Since It's Halloween, We thought we'd play the secret song"" - KRIST live
from the stage

""13 minutes, and 51 seconds after the beginning of track 12, the band put
a secret song on the Nevermind CD. This mystery song didn't make the
first pressing though. Dave explains"" - ST THOMAS

""When we got our first CD, and popped it in, we listened to it, 'Oh,
Oh! Let's check to see if that track is there!', and it wasn't there.
The reason for it, I think the original reason was because, Something
In The Way is sorta like your slower, whatever song it's the last song
on the record, most likely to be listened to by like someone who would
have a carousel CD player, and so okay, why not like 'screw up their
little carousel deal!' I was talking to a friend who works in a
record store, and he said uh, a person came in with the CD, and said
'Y'know, this thing's screwed up. After the last song, there's like,
this 10 minutes of dead space, then this total noise song' He wanted
his money back! And the person at that store said, 'Well, I think
maybe it was like a joke of the band .y'know, put it on after,' and
he goes 'Well I don't think it's very funny y'know!', and he wanted his
money back! It was just like"" - DAVE

To keep you back one second longer

Bite back the hand that feeds you

There's sun on your face and you're smiling a way
That really gives nothing away

Just judging by the shadows, it's noon or maybe one or two
You've got the rest of the day and your whole life to play
And the world is waiting on you

But I really just can't remember the night that you went away
It happened so fast, so long in the past
Did I ever know this girl by the lake?
Did I even know the girl by the lake?

To live is to fly and I'm learning to try
But sometimes it's all such a chore
If the breeze doesn't come and clouds block the sun
You've got to work harder to soar

We're all here just a dancing like we know what we are trying to do
But the fact is you can't so you dance and you dance
Keep on moving till the music is through

There's nothing that says that you have to, no rules that say you must
And what may seem unfair is just fates way of daring
Us all to learn how to trust

It's sun on a butterfly's wings stretching them out to dry
And a breeze to help with the chore
But if the breeze doesn't come and clouds block the sun
You've got to work harder to soar.

Well the picture I have is you standing in front of a lake
And you smiling a way that gives nothing away

TRAMFHI12903CB4349.h5,Goatwhore,A Closure in Infinity,2003,"The crest light of divinity will never shine
Contemporarily refined through a catastrophic hell
Buried deep within the blood of traditional revolution
A distrust to decipher man's evolution,
The future never known
A black hole of undivine nature for destruction of heresy
The stellar cycle about to be sucked into the imploding dark star to resurface an early cycle of man for a new millenium
Closure begins in collapse, Dissolving into the raven giant
We are timeless... within damnation
Outer descent thrown into a reversal of extinction
No emotion within this promise of damnation
On sorelines of the perverse
The Armageddon of prophecies unfold
This threshold of an event horizon
Collapses into a closure of negative density
Look past the stories of life
Look beyond these lies of a garden of delight
The serpents tale is only beginning of this interstellar rebirth
Hell's cold fire
Begin a cycle reborn
Devouring of utopia
Attain within non-escape
Haste to collide with this transitional barrier that makes a dead man free
The cold ground is a warm death that leaves the personal idea of dying a lonesome rebirth
Grasp towards the sky from within this depression
As mountains of scattered head stones lay
A far worse burial stigma becoming the inquisition 
The black heart of cold faith
Bare this cross a tranquil agnostic epitaph
The delivery of a condemned ideal
The veil closes its swollen eyes from above
This bitter evocation sealing the blackness of love"

I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day i'll fly away when jesus comes calling for me
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when he comes calling for me
When jesus comes calling for me
When i die don't grieve and cry
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When jesus comes calling for me
When he comes calling for me

I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or i might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old muley and me
Wherever i am, whatever i'm a doing, some sweet day i'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when jesus comes calling for me
When he comes calling for me

When i die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When jesus comes calling for me

So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's nowt you can say

To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

To all the smirking faces and the boys in black

Why can't they have a laugh?

They want arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just

A story to tell you

I was wise when i was with you, i died with you a million deaths and everytime i was born again but the last time you took my breath left me never to breath again, never to breath again

Give me life, give me hope, give me strength to hold on give me life, give me hope, give me strength to hold on

I want one more day to rise above this jail
I want one more day to rise above this hell
The walls are wet and cold, inside this bottomless hole your fingernails slip on the slime, it's harder and harder to climb we sinking deeper, deeper into hell.

Thoughts bleeds down my face, my brain wears a thorny crown
Look out johnny ace, the devil coming back to town, He's gona give your guns to me,
He's gona give your guns to me
He's gona give your guns to me

Give me life, give me hope, give me strength to hold on. Give me life, give me hope, give me strength to hold on

She used to drink in the hills
Only now she drinks in the valleys

A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home
But with a thousand miles of real estate to choose from
You begin to see the value of your freedom...
The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer voice
Crying out, mummy won't come out of the bathroom
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
but he's buried in the screenplay of his feature

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens, a pool of vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping
Suicide in the hills above old Hollywood
Is never gonna change the world
Change the world overnight
Any more than the invention of the six-gun - child
Any more than the discovery of Radium,
Or California tipping in the ocean

Durch die Wälder Asgaards, Gullveig rief man sie 
Als sie vor den Toren Valhalls Einlass begehrte 
Öffneten die Asen ihr voller Sympathie 
Gullveig's Lächeln hatte Macht, ihr Plan war ein Gemeiner 
Mit der Kraft der Schönheit hat sie Odin's Volk getrügt 

Einmal in der Feste luden Odin und die anderen 
Gullveig ein zu trinken, sie nahm 
Als das Fest gefeiert wurde fing sie an zu reden 
Über Gold und Geld und was man damit alles kann 
Viele Asen hörten zu und fingen an zu schmachten 
Wollten Reichtum, stritten dann und schlugen aufeinander ein. 

Als der Streit am ärgstens war, die Asen sich bekriegten 
Blickte Vater Odin Gullveig ins Gesicht 
Er sah wie sie lachte, wie sie diese Gräuel erfreute 
Dass auch Schwerter kreisten darum scherte sie sich nicht 
""Brüder!"", rief er. ""Haltet ein! Das Weib will uns vernichten 
Zwietracht ist der Hexen Saat. Sie keimt in ihrem Blut."" 

""Kaum gesprochen endete der Kampf der Asenmeute 
Alle blickten jählings auf die Hexe voller Hass 
Gullveig fühlte augenblicklich dass die List nicht glückte 
Sie fing an zu zittern, wurde plötzlich leichenblass 
Odin schrie: ""Dein falsches Spiel soll deinen Tod besiegeln! 
Brennen sollst du Hexenweib, dein Ende sei gewiss!"" 

Augenblicklich stürzten sich die Asen auf die Hexe 
Banden sie und schlugen ihr die Fäuste in den Leib 
Odin sprach: ""Der Scheiterhaufen soll dein Ende bringen! 
Niemand stört der Asen Ruhe und nun brenne, Weib!"" 
Kaum gesprochen, ward es wahr die Hexe stand in Flammen 
Als das feuer ausgebrannt war, lachte Gullveig laut. 

""Niemand ist imstande mir mein Leben zu entreissen"" 
sprach die Riesin doch die Asen taten es erneut 
Weitere zwei Male wollten sie das Weib entzünden 
Doch die Hexe starb nicht und das hat sie nicht erfreut

We was walkin, and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice from Mr. Virgo Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played ?if it was sock? and they swoop and backstab
People start to smile inside we buckwhylin
Sayin this all started back from freestylin
They liked it, and they were very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo E, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was luvy duvy
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy

He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can't do no more for him Jim

I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it I wanted to run

He laid his head on my knees
I stroke the best pal that a man ever found
I cried so I scaresly could see

Old Shepy he knew he was going to go
for he reached out and nipped at my hand
He looked up at me just as much as to say
We're parting but you'll understand

In your heart girl, there's nothing left but misery
Come dance while I'm getting free I'm gonna lie again

Cause there ain't no point in the words I write
There ain't no way to get me But I sure was high when I saw your smile
But now your always, oh yes you're always gone girl

And all my senses seem to shine through the day
Seem to shine through the day, honey that's okay
Yes all my senses seem to shine in the night
Seem to shine in the night, honey that's alright

All my senses seem to shine in the night
Seem to shine in the night, honey that's alright
And all my senses seem to be in this song
Thinking all day long, honey what went wrong
Tell me what went wrong
Tell me what went wrong"

For whom the angels sing
And who would have tho't that as He grew
And with other children played

Would die for them some day

While our banner of decency is torn
Debating over disarmament
Killing children before they're born
And fools who march to win the right
To justify their sin
Oh ev'ry nation that has fallen
Has fallen from within
Yet in the midst of this darkness
There is a hope a light that burns

Was born a King that day

There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

And I'll scare you right out of your pants

To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can

That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood

Please fasten your seatbelts in the interest of safety
Atlanta welcomes you to come witness the light
What you've been waitin for this fine saturday night
Yes, that's right, come one, come all
Through the boondocks to all suburban shopping malls
Trailer parks, the PJs, country clubs, and ghettos
This is your saturday night special

It's saturday and the club smells like cigarettes and aftershave
Survival of the fittest, we're the last remaining castaways
Crack the stage, tear the roof off and collapse the place
A new breed of emcee with characteristics of a master race
Captivated, you can't recall who those others are
Make you drop to your knees and thank god you paid the cover charge
Love is hard to listen to, cause we're softly killing
It's been a long time since you've had feelings this original
Second nature like breathing slow for those like Ishmael
The bases that you need to know, we supply the remedy
Each cypher is a china shop, we break porcelain figurines
The mic is a weapon and you've got suicidal tendencies
Stammer and stutter through your twenty minute train wreck
The 9 to 5 is right here with or without a paycheck
You're like a sure thing, disconnect is a safe bet
Wait a sec, just heard you hit record on your tape deck
Call your local DJ and make him put it on repeat
This song is the reason Americans practice free speech
When The Source has less street cred than Teen Beat
Every weekend shut it down and listen up when we speak

There's thugs in the club
There's drugs in the club

Is home for those that ripping like us

So click, bow! mix six shots for hip-hop
We're goin state to state with this, so your city is just a pit stop
Or for however long my set is
I'ma rep this from georgia to california to jersey back down to Texas
A real emcee don't rely on marketing the gimmicks
When I told him to stop writing, I was targeting the mimics
So make some noise for me and Manchild and of course there's Dust
Raise your voices up, and enjoy the rush
You can trust that we gonna gonna give you what you came for, and a little bit more
Something for you to spend your change on when it finally hits stores
I might battle before or after the show or after I flow
We gonna know that I'm official like the tag in the store, yeah

We keep it fresh like your mouth after chewin some Cinnaburst

Yeah I spit a verse I wrote today I can't wait till the ink settles
Bring it through the blinking lights, broken dreams, and drink specials

You think bezzles and chains will define you as an emcee
But if you rhyme after I'm finished shining the club gonna be empty

To put it simply, this is life and living it is on you
Giving ya'll the means to be limitless if you want to

But I warn you, this is a about as real as it gets
To make it in this takes patience like dealing with kids

Right, and I can't spare the rod because effectively we change the pace
Save the face of music on weekends plus the labor days

In a major way this is the way we play the game
So say the name, issues with Mars Ill still spitting these waves of flames

Maybe some day you'll be blessed to find our presence in your county

Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrel when its bolt-locked nigga

Have you ever lost a loved one?
Or never understood love till you lost one?
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at? Strength missing
To take losses is the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave hearted
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts at

This is to my physical you gone to me you still here
I be buggin' thinking how you doin' up there
Probably watching over me calling out my fouls
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child
I miss that ass tell God I said, ""Pardon me""
If your real, he'll forgive me, no doubt
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down niggaz front it's on

Ain't wetting going to jail you better shoot me
Just lost my heart, if I die you comin' wit' me
Quickly while I'm pissy they're just bitches thats' a little to frisky
Risky on point hope these cats is getting the point whisper out my name
Stand but please don't point call me paranoid
But I'm on point close by the stash joint got you in my mind
I guess thats why the say love is blind

Strength missing we take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave hearted
You better finish what you started dunn
If you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love till you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at? Strength missing

To take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave hearted
Now lets find out where niggaz hearts at
Have you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love till you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mines' behind wit' my dearly departed
Now where your heart at?

I find myself dozing off with it
Waking up every forty minutes
Soaking wet dripped to death in it
On top of rules big barrels and tools get tested
And hittin' off makes my dick get erected
We all strive for a better tomorrow
But as far as today your ass gotsa' pay
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with
Some timers, playa' hata's and dick riders
Bent niggaz' that be crashin' into dividers
Gettin' you into shit got that ass tied up
Got them la'd up got you comin' out of your vault
With no plans of giving back live in serious debt
Your lady fucking other niggaz you a fool for her
Talking 'bout you got money you just using her
Actually loosin' her"

No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts to the ghetto

Yes, the crack and the metal
He takes no days off, for gettin' his cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much he pissed Jose off
Now, Jose was the cocaine boss

Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin' his sister
Hittin' Shorty off 'cuz he had love for his sister
And Shorty had no love for his sister
'Cuz sister would sniff up everythin' Jose gives her

But Shorty had a plan for 'em both
'Cuz he was good at handlin' coke so Jose liked him
Problem was, he was pitchin' for the dudes down the street
You know, CJ, Big Boo and Meleke

Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
CJ, well, he's just anotha nigga
But, despite the fact, they didn't like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat

And bein' that he was a bitch and he ain't know when it's here
They set it up to get him there 'n hit him there
But Shorty was smart, so before they got to load up 'n spark
He said, ""Hold up my heart, please""
Then he said, ""Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag""

It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came from
It get it from Jose, believe me it's more where that came from
Yea, he had 'em lost in the game one

They let him go thinkin' that he would let 'em know
Where Jose was keepin' the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose 'bout that
And we all know Jose 'bout that

Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back, what?
In a chair like there's no way out that, nope
He said, ""Shoot 'em I'ma blow they house back
Next day he sent the 2-way out town""

And somebody blew they house down
Jose think Shorty on his side
But he don't know Shorty on his side, word
So Shorty called, ""Jose, like listen, it's goin' down
I need more cocaine, bring it""

So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? CJ, Meleke and Boo sped up
You shoulda seen the look on Jose's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face

Told him no man's great and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
Then he said, ""Where's my sister before I kill you?""

I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody

I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman

Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Like Jerry Lee Swaggart or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter on what? The popcorn
Sippin' on wine and mackin'
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin'
Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me

After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

I only leave em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents
(Rakaa) Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to
the end zone

[Chorus]

When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin

Frost in summer, to chill your heart
A drifting memory of autumn decay
A shadowed soul in a fetter of light

An abyssic voice in purile mind... a fallen one
Wandering by the shores, of eternal sin...

The sun no longer shines here
Endless waves roll upon the endless shores
A sullen ship drifts upon the blackest tide
Beneath darkened boughs, no song is heard...
An endless forest where the devil's shadows play
...here I am King

I know no other world
I know no other...
For here I am King
And a King I shall stay...

Take my hand...
Imrama...
To an eternal infinity
Where the stars burn in my name"

Somewhere where last night you loved me
And in the early mornin' chill my arms remember still
But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone

I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone

Your hot breath and your laughter
Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone

I'm running out of love and I'm running out of passion
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love and I long for restitution
Someday you wake up and I'll be far away
How long did you think you could keep on doin' me wrong
How long did you think I'd stay quiet and take it
The love I had for you is almost gone
I ain't gonna let you take my heart and break it
I'm running out of love...
You come and gone just anytime you want to
And you never bother to tell me where you're goin'
Now I wonder if there's anything you don't do
Someday you pay for the wild seeds you sowin'

Wish that I could die in my sleep
And Lord knows, thru his grace I done tried it wit peace
But it's like niggas ain't happy 'til they find me deceased
Feel the grief, of a street, nigga that turned to rap
And just applied Everything that he learned from crack
I'm in now, it's life ain't no turning back, it been foul
So what kinda concerns is that
Peep the signs of the eyes ''cause it tell it all
One of the few in the Streets that was selling it raw
Made mistakes, but it made me intelligent more
And how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor
How can the hate from another man stop my flow
That's like another pimp thinking he can knock my hoe
I'm here now, just trying to copp and blow, couple of cars and lot's of Doe

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see

But I'ma keep on doing me, 'til I die

One by one, seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall, you seen one nigga ball
you done seen 'em all
Even standup niggas seen 'em lean and crawl
What makes a man wanna fiend for more
Life itself is more than a trial or a quest
Intelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best
And very rarely, you can catch me casually - dressed
I'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats
Doing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men
Around for months then they gone again
Incarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts
Criminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?
Where we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed
Spoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose
Get yours, hit a quota then get indoors, get legit
Then hit them stores

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'ma keep on doing me, 'til I die

So now it's on y'all, could see, I figured it out
Only a few could say that they been in my house
And caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch
I'm as low as you can go in the south
When it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate
Some say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes
What make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age
Understand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways
Knee deep in what I speak ''cause I spit the truth
I become angelic when I sit in the booth
Just a thought of all the ill sh*t that lurk in streets
How can another real nigga wanna work wit police
Bad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough
I took an oath just to smoke, eat, sleep and fuck
Knowledge of self, I'ma do this regardless of wealth
Regardless of how the deck and how the cards get dealth

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto

Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?

To escape the Haitian heat
The hunger pains drive them to the street
Wond'ring if today they'll eat
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease.

The least of these is sick.
The least of these needs clothing.
The least of these needs drink.

The least of these knows sorrow.
The least of these knows grief.
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

I say what I mean and mean what I say
Chasin' dreams night-by-night and day-after-day
I met a broad at the titty bar
Called 'Starlight' becuz her eyes twinkled like little stars

There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Everyday your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
Ive been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to Heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what all right even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I've been all around the world, boys
Now I'm trying to get to Heaven before they close the door

Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm trying to get to Heaven before they close the door"

You were the one that didn't turn your back

And a Bible in your right hand you said, ""Turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek""

Lord, he spent a fortune on his prized possession
And to him she was worth every cent

is fine, but realize that you've got to be aware.
I know it's hard, and I'm glad to be there,
but i will see so much more if my mind stays clear.
Jah is speaking just listen to the birds,

'cause the plants and the animals are all messengers.
So seek, and you will find relation
'cause Jah earth and all in it, we are one creation.

Check it...
There were men who used to live that way,
they didn't need guns or knives to survive in those days...
Till Babylon came with their false reality -
The earth used to provide more than we could ever need.
Now it seems like we're going the wrong way,
""Forward ever, backwards never"" as the wise man say.
Let us go back to the way they used to live,
So the earth can be around for our children's kids

Homicide, it's a homicide
Everyday commit to don't tell no lie

Yo they say murder is the way to go
And it'll be the day you go
When I run up on you with a 40, tho
I'll shoot you like a' animal
This is unexplainable
When they think that's life's so unfadeable
They kill 'em at will an' away they go
But me, I'd rather just play it slow
They don't think life is valuable
When there's doubt, that's all they know [?]
There's always another child to go
And they don't want to be held accountable
The laws of life are pliable
This heater is so reliable
Get shot with a Glock on yo bock
And death is undeniable

And south side it's a homicide

It is murder in the first degree
And you won't be the first to be
Shot in the chest with a shotgun
And hauled off into surgery
Shots rang off in front of me
Kinda feel like their huntin me
I don't know what they want from me
But if I pull out a gun, they all run from me
Wanna put a man underneath
Maybe it's because they want to be
Maybe it's because they're hungry
Maybe it's because they're ugly
It's the cold steel [that] protects the eye
In case someone disrespects the guy [?]
Life that can't be rectified
Let's see who's the next to die

(Modified Hook)

They say live by the gun, die by one
Right there by your side you got one
Ready to haul off and shoot the hot one
Kill a man right down to his life guard, got one [?]
Man you can't kill everyone
And your gun better be a heavy one
Killin the wicked is never fun
Sendin 'em all up to a heaven one [?]
Every time you step in the spot
Talkin about your weapons you got
What type of hammer that'll let you go pop
Talkin about you reppin the block
Man I just can't understand this war goin on all over the planet
Everybody got an automatic
They grab their gats as soon as they panic

Some of our soldiers have fallen, so many years of toiling
Touring, tears falling, naw pouring jaded from the industries
Jabs a lil' slower like Muhammad Ali but still we able to last

So we go in the studio, it felt new but yet in a good way
It felt old routines, we did came back so lucid, we was boosted
We juiced it and came up with some tracks that's stupid

And people responded to 'em, heads on the blocks
With locks and baggie jeans, the whole scene was fond to 'em
And how we got the labels kissing our hind parts
We desired art and never sold out for the high chart positions

And thus they detach their roots from the soil that kept them loose
And made what they delivered so true

Feeling thrown out like woody in toy story two
And yo we felt that but let me tell you Satan, he dealt that

The trees are drawing me near,
I've got to find out why.
Those gentle voices I hear
Explain it all with a sigh.
I'm looking at myself, reflections of my mind.
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind.
So gently swaying through the fairy-land of love,
If you could just come with me and see the beauty of

Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in

I'm just ya ordinary guy get high
Make my trees do my things
Handle my resposibilities
And I swing with my peeps
Late night hit the streets solo creeps
Gettin' busy in between the sheets
That's how we do get this money
And yo run our shit
Got my guns shiesty motherfuckers wanna end
Me and my team mad 'cause they ain't got what we got
So they come tryin' to blow up the spot

Hear we got skills plus we got gats
Plus we got a click that's fuckin' quick to react
I lay low where my head be
Besides the loot I got niggas tryin' to jack me
I tell cats that I can't fuck around now
I gotta chill nigga hold the fort down now
Niggas still always tryin' to fuckin' put shit in the game
On and off stage it's all the same

Yes indeed man I hope we all achieve the goal
To succeed and be all we can be
I recommend that you defend 'til the end G
Now basically I'm seein' younger cats dead in years
Before my younger cats was older cats sheddin' tears
Seen my peoples caught up in the mix Black
Some people say that there's no way to fix that

Younger cats get your knowledge education
Get this here we didn't get that information
As you can see I'm just an older cat gettin' down
Send my message through my livin' plus I'm sound
Besides man I runs with the L B

Worked hard but they still's not givin'

Hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear

Rearrange their face

I keep driving to the most desolate seclusions
my blackest secrets still imprison me
and why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...
whatever lies will help you rest
whenever things are at their best...
why do we wait for it to fall apart?
fall apart

Welcome to the after-taste
of cheap wine and bad decisions
my heart trembles in this morning prayer
I can't turn my eyes
from this inner most seductions
but still somehow you found me there
and why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...
whatever lies will help you rest
whenever things are at their best...
why do we wait for it to fall apart?

It's my mistake to say
I'm not the world safest bet
I've never been too good at being good
and its probably sad to say...

Whenever things are at their best...
whatever lies will help you rest
whenever things are at their best...
why do we wait for it to fall apart?

Whenever things are at their best...
whatever lies will help you rest
whenever things are at their best...
why do we wait for it to fall apart?"

There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born of the Spirit
And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope that's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?

There is a joy in the journey,
There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey."

Fork up beyond the bend.

Beneath the flutter of desperate wings,
They sing a song of reclamation,
Where tomorrows hanging horizon,
Interrupts the hum of electrical towers.

Here, there are the shallow graves,
The shallower romances,
And the shallowest of words still to be spoken,
And there you are with open ears.

This is called love for the workers in song

Heaven sent relief for those of us who still believe
In the therapy and the merit of screaming
Reckless anthems of youth until our throats give out
Burning down the highway in a broken down van
Seeing the world through said go nowhere dead end
We are famous
We are brave
And our words will change the world
Today we'll tear open the heartland
Our amps go to eleven and our hearts will beat forever
So here we are, three thousand miles from home
We're all in this together and I never feel alone
Songs are made for singing
Leave loose ends be
Looting super centers cooking in truck stop microwaves
Sleeping on bottles of piss and the floors of the gracious

From here on out it's all disappointment
From here on out it's all compromise

Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
(Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
(Speak to me)

I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
(Is on empty)

No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air
(Liftin' you 10 feet)
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
(Of all you)
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song
'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
(Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
(On Marilyn)

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now, it's a tragedy
Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin' this happenin'
(This happenin')

Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
(Rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am

Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is""

And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
(Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk

With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
(Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who what when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
(Drivin' me crazy)
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am

Now the gravel was flying as he turned the bend
And screeched to a grinding halt

And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens

""Well, y'all timed that one just about right

Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
Long enough to see your friends betray you

Now, I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first
And give me a death I always longed for

Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half, infanticide

No pack to bury the heart of stone

Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Down in Ville Acuna

And pick it up sometime today
And while i'm there
I might have to check out Manuel's cafe

It's a cool life
Continuity
A little air conditioner
In my silver air stream
But i need to kick back
And see what condition i'm in
'Cause it won't be long
Till i'm down at miss Crosby's again

I need Menutha

We will die for the truth in our hearts
No force that exists will steal us from his hands
Nothing will tear us apart

Though the mirror is dull, the reflection obscured
We look beyond the obtuse
And the world weighs down beating us to the ground
But her efforts are of little use

The anointed one has purchased our souls
Death is battered and lifeless before me
The truth rains down for the children of Christ
And the truth has set us free

And through it all we rise when we fall
Though the road grows more narrow before me
Though we ache, though we cry, never break, never die
The one truth there is sets us free"

A tramp lay dying in the park.
I knelt beside him to hear him speak
And the words he spoke, they were oh so weak.

He told me a story of long since past,
Of a sailing ship with its long grey mast,
Of his captain's cap with it's shining braid
And the wonderful voyages that he'd made.

""Silent Annie"" was his great ship's name.
Like a token of love he spoke her name.
She sailed 'round the Horn, aye, more that once.
She could cut through the waves like a sharpened lance.

""Believe me,"" he said. His eyes filled with tears
Like a drunk on a corner, trying to remember his years.
He reached out his hand and I took it in mine.
""I believe you,"" I said, and he gave a sad smile.

""I remember the day when they towed her away.
Her sides they were sore from the sea's angered spray.
They said she's unfit for to sail out once more
(And they towed her more inward from her own sandy shore)?

And as they broke my Silent Annie. I watched with a sigh.
I remembered her beauty when I was a boy.
She was my one love, my life's only dream,
When we sailed out together as captain and queen.""

It started to drizzle, and I felt my hand tight
And he squeezed even harder as he ended the fight.
And a crowd they had gathered, and they watched with dismay
As some ambulance men came, and they took him away.

So I got to my feet, and I walked through that park.
The sun it was gone, but it was not yet dark.
My body was wet, and my clothes were not many,
But my mind was aroused by the ship Silent Annie."

That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded

Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a screen from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style

Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guaranteed to help when I walk on the court

I'm serious Dre my sounds

To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go

To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen now, 'cause I'mma break it down

And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made

Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat

Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit' me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean

Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit

And wait for an answer my friend
Maybe you will hear from me an echo in the wind
And a song that has no end

With a head full of books he'd forgotten
Bad memories from days in the war
Crowded out by the tales of tall cotton
Why can't all things be just like before
The world though the eyes of my father
Repeating mistakes that he made
Refusing to lose the illusion
That one day he would lead the parade

Now he sits in the library day after day
With a wire a compass and pen
Uncovering a secret so long lost away
That will never be spoken again
Inventor of stories so deep in the heart
That will only come out in a dream
We can carve out a place or reverse into space
In the next world we'll know what they mean

We were climbing the steps to the graveyard
With regrets and our baggage in tow
From the cliffs of the Ardarine mountains
You can see the sweet memories below
There was nothing here left but a portrait
On a mission here only to serve
An empty room with a glass and a bottle
It's all that us free men deserve"

X-Raided up in this bitch, bout to disrupt some shit,
Ain't from the pound, but I'm still down to Kurupt some shit,
Interrupt your shit, cuz I'm always in a rush to spit,
Like an axe, when I rap, I splitter up your clique,
You better relax, be a witness or a participant,
Eddie Gaffin' laughin' at the CO, wonder where the Sergeants went,
See we flow, but it's way more bigger than that,
Ransom note, deliver the gats and all them wack ass tracks,
So we slit his throat, it's malicious, but the game's vicious,

Stole everything like clepto includin' your dome,
Left your ass chewed up, gaze blast, mid-section blew up,

Suit up, in coca sacks then I smoke a bag,
They make me get my focus back, then I choke the gat

Fuck dividin' the power, wanted every cranny and nook,

I mean that sincerely,
Love my alcohol and tetrahydracanebanol dearly,
Consumin' twenty pounds yearly,
Clearly I'm out for the cash, nothin' else in my vision,
Takin' chances, makin' decisions that could keep me in prison,
But circumstances keep demandin' me to break these laws,
Writin' lyrics strong enough to, penetrate these walls,
Dott Dogg, don't feel I'm guilty,
As charged, I'm filthy really,
Down for the cause, and I'm comin' raw til' they kill me feel me,
With slugs to the dome, ain't no love so it's on,

Got some advice for 'em,
You better recognize, Raided ain't down for none of that bullshit,
Got a full clip, and this man eater won't hesitate to pull it,
And deliver the bullets to your chest like a mailman droppin' off letters,
Fat hole in your sweater,
Smash out with all your cheddar,
Met a nigga that had much game, deeper than the abyss,
Taught me such thangs as how to get fame and keepin' cash in my fist,
Now I insist to get my scrilla scratch,
How real is that?
And I'm quick to peel a niggas cap,
Is you feelin' that?
Move swiftly when I see the cops, cuz I ain't scrillin',
Muthafuckas wanna see me drop, but I ain't willin',
You a pawn in my book,

Calm and fearless in the rain

All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

Has blown all darkness far away

Although we've just begun to leave
We will tarry not to say we were wrong
to leave behind a silent reproach
And when our eyes are searching out
And our hearts are beating strong
We'll have a reason not to grieve
With holly leaves and scanning skies
And if the colors fade into night
And the storms our heads enclose
And our souls are set against one another

And the skies mock our lowliness

Reclaim and ignite the sky.
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive.
Dam the rise of grime and rats.

Painting their brinks gold.
Keen sycophants fitly scheming-
Furthering the feuds of their adored.

Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place-
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside

No genuine light to be found.
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy,
So the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for

You're the ""Best he Ever Had""
Rumors come and go
But you keep your shadow
Everywhere you go it follows
Can't understand I still love you
(watch the blogs talk about this one)
Chorus:

Soon as I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn you let me down-down-down
Cause you're a famous girl
For breaking hearts

You're famous girl (girl)
Girl (girl) 
Girl (girl)

Should've known you'd break my heart (heart)
Heart (heart)

Verse 2:

Keri would've said my love ""Knocks Her Down""
Keyshia would've told me I was ""Sent From Heaven""
Sorry B I don't wear no ""Halo""
You were first to play the game though
Sorry I ""Bust The Windows"" out your car

I might have cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing ""Disturbia""
But I meant it in ""Forever""
We were 'posed to be together
And I can't let you go

Chorus:

Soon as you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like damn I let you down
Down (down)
Down (down)
Guess I'm famous girl for breaking hearts

I'm famous girl (girl)
Girl (girl) 
Girl (girl) (x3)

Didn't know I'd break your heart (x2)

(x2) 

Hook:

Many hearts we should've left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure I wish time was frozen
Seems we lost our way
Now I hope you're happy being famous girl

Chorus: 

Your famous girl (girl girl)
Should've known that you would break my heart (You're famous girl girl girl)
Should have known you would leave me lonely (You're famous girl girl girl) yeah
Shoul've known that you would break my heart (That you would break my heart heart heart)
But then again I'm famous girl (I'm famous girl girl girl)
I've broken my share of hearts (I'm famous girl girl girl) (yeah yeah yeah yeah)(I'm famous girl girl girl)

Struggling along just to hold on
I just wanna know why is it me

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's the hope gone astray
I cry so hard, sometimes, too scared to think, what will bring tomorrow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn there's no justice to fate

Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just want to know why is it me

You know plenty has made it my way
You ain't got a monopoly on sorrow

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts, hurts, hurts

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

Sorry for fuckin' up your little tea party
My bad, just wanna show you how we party
Losers night out, hit the club like a champ
Find me a spot on the floor and set up my camp
Cuttin' up the amps and dancin' with some ladies
Been livin' shady since the late eighties
A date maybe, in a purple moon

Offa brown rum, green bud and off tour
Off the head, offa the pacific shore

Like estrogen
Little mama with the sexy skin
Still lets me in
In the bay jet skiin'
With two lesbians
I leans gangsta
Whatever you catch me in
Even a Harley lookin' out for pedestrians

The center is action packed
Adrenaline
Raw raps will hinder them
With more momentum than a pendulum shift
Bear witness to the synthesis I'm hittin' em with

Nigga burn somethin', learn somethin'
Blow somethin' like you want something'
If not, lemme hold somethin'

Hold your composure

TRAWTUG12903CB2DB8.h5,Don Francisco,Gotta Tell Somebody,1991,"She kept on getting weaker as day dragged into day
The doctors gave no hope for her; she seemed to fade away
My hours were filled with constant dread; time became a knife
That slowly and relentlessly cut the cord of life

There was a teacher in the region then some of us had heard
That He'd healed the paralytic by the power of just His Word
So with hope again rekindled I went at once to see
If I could find a man named Jesus from a town in Galilee

I began to search the city and soon I saw the crowd
They were pressing in to touch Him and they called His Name out loud
But with the strength of desperation I pushed them all aside
I through myself before Him and from my knees I cried

""Lord, come and heal my daughter, even now she's close to death
Her fever's uncontrollable, she fights for every breath
But God's given You the power; life is Yours to give
If you'll just lay Your hands on her I know that she will live""
(She will live, she will live)

Well, He'd just begun to go with me when a face I saw with fear
Came towards me with the news I knew I didn't want to hear
And although I tried to steel myself I trembled when he said
""Why bother the Teacher anymore, your little girl is dead.""

Then Jesus touched my shoulder and He told me not to grieve
The trembling stopped when He looked at me and said, ""Only believe""
Then He sent the crowds away except His closest men
And they followed right behind us as we started off again

But we were still a long ways down the road when I heard the sounds and cries
Of the mourners and musicians as they strove to dramatize
My grief they had no business with beneath their loud disguise
My wife just sat there silently and stared through empty eyes

Then Jesus asked the mourners, ""Why is it that you weep?
She isn't dead as you suppose, the child is just asleep.""
It only took a moment for their wails to turn to jeers
""Who does this man think he is? Get him out of here!""

With authority I've never heard in the lips of any man
He spoke and every sound rolled out with the thunder of command
And in the sudden silence they all hurried for the door
Wondering what the reasons were they'd ever come there for

Then He called his three disciples that were with Him on the way
He led them and my wife and me to where our daughter lay
He took her by the hand; He told her ""Child, arise""
And the words were barely spoken when she opened up her eyes

She rose and walked across the room and stood there at our sides
My wife knelt down and held her close and at last she really cried
And then Jesus told us both to see that our daughter had some food
But as to how her life was saved, not to speak a word...
Not to speak a word...

I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody
I got to tell somebody, got to tell somebody, what Jesus did for me
I got to tell somebody, got to tell somebody, what Jesus did for me

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day

I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from whack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV

Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo, MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, 'cause to them that's wrong
Cause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong

Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle
The funk tracks produced by EPMD
But it's a fat jam, that will never win a Grammy

Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence

Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that, ""No sir, yes sir, and thank you, ma'am""
'Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored

And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel

Which means next time, so observe these rhymes
And take a stand and go for yours cause I'm going for mine

Why is that when wrong is done by the black
It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked?
By the press and yes, conflict is caused
By the kids at concerts who bum rush the doors

One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty
But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence
So fight the power and make them understand
But too much power and you might get banned

Let's go see my dear old Mammy

That's what I like about the South
Now there you can make no mistakey
Where those nerves are never shaky
Ought to taste her layer, cakey
That's what I like about the South
She's got baked ribs and candied yams
Those sugar-cured Virginia hams
Basement full of those berry jams
An' that's what I like about the South
Hot corn bread, black eyed peas
You can eat as much as you please
'Cause it's never out of season
That's what I like about the South
Ah, don't take one, have two
There's dark brown and chocolate too
Suits me, they must suit you
'Cause that's what I like about the South
Well it's way, way down where the cane grows tall
Down where they say, ""Y'all""
Walk on in with that Southern drawl
'Cause that's what I like about the South
Down where they have those pretty queens
Keep a-dreamin' those dreamy dreams
Well let's sip that absinthe in New Orleans
That's what I like about the South
Here come old Bob with all the news
Got the box back coat with button shoes
An' that's what I like about the South
Here come old Roy down the street
Ho, can't you hear those tappin' feet
He would rather sleep than eat
An' that's what I like about the South
Now every time I pass your door
You act like you don't want me no more
Why don't you shake that head and sigh
And I'll go walkin' by
On, on, on and on and on
Honey, when you tell me that you love me
Then how come you close your eyes
Did I tell you 'bout the place called doo wah, diddy
It ain't no town and it ain't no city
It's just awful small, but awful pretty
That's doo wah, diddy
Well I didn't come here to criticize
I'm not here to sympathize
But don't tell me those no-good lies
That a lyin' gal like you can devise
You love me like I love you
Send me fifty P D Q
Roses are red and violets are pink
If I don't get all fifty, I don't show
She's got backbones and turnip greens
Ham hocks and butter beans
You, me and New Orleans

Do you admit regret in times of doubt? (We will think for you.)
A life of gun in hand, with a dedication to your land,
Inside out you've shown it's not what life's all about.

No, we can not believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead (mislead.)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,
We'll be here to see your life through.

I'm confused and punctured,
My conscience is my only means of direction.
Did I sign up for suicide, of a saddened bride?
Three more years, no white picket fencing, and suffering a mental conviction.

Please, don't you think that now we will look down,
On a man who's realized what's true to him now? (to him now)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,
We'll be here to see your life through. (to see your life)

It's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see.
When you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell.
SO COCK THE GUN AND FIRE INTO THE EYES OF A GREAT DESIRE.
A fleeting destiny that is turned into what is considered to be normal.
And I'm here for you.

No, we can not believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead (mislead.)

Speak for the part of the street that keep it ugly
And niggaz couldn't wear my shoes
'Cause the places that I walk, most catz couldn't bear my dues

Or pay the tolls of the roads I done kept on, crept on
Walk 'til I got tired then curled up and slept on
My journey has earned me the right to reach
I burned so I earned the right to teach, what to eat

What niggaz been gettin' fed is pork
What you niggaz been gettin' fed, shouldn't be even on your fork
Let's talk, about this, and about that
Yeah, we like this or we can do it out back

Keep the bullshit for the rodeo

Hit you wit' something for frontin' that'll end your life
Then hit your crib and bend your wife

What you think behind my back suck my dick, how's about that?
Loose lifts is loose clips and crews hit
I run with niggaz from Israel to hijack crew ships

Watch the news at 6, that's how I'm gettin' down

This is a grown-up game, thinkin' 'cause you got a blown-up name

Nuttin' but gun firing, blap blap blap blap

Told stupid muthafucka to stop runnin', or run in
To a buck shot, can't duck off shot
It's that click click boom you outta luck shot

And I'ma feed 'em every time I sing, do my thing

I don't have a lot, but I'm proud of what I've got
I can't complain
'Cause I see people hangin' round, on the city streets downtown
Living on pocket change
There're times I've been confused, felt that I was born to lose
Oh but I survived
Unlike the one's who pray and feel more than blessed each day
To just be still alive

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
The only hope they have will die
In the hearts of you and I if nothing's ever done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just turn my head
And walk on by
Don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I

Seems that old golden rule, that I learned back in school
Has lost its shine
It's a crying shame, and I wonder could the blame
Be yours and mine
Discipline was tough, and that old principal was rough
But the times were good
'Cause no one ever found one single child shot down
In the neighborhood

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
'Cause every day that passes by
Another street gang victim dies
And still there's nothing done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just run away somewhere and hide
From the fear and the danger of those less fortunate than I
Lord don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I"

This blood drenched man, seemed to cry for help, as he stared at me, his eyes were changing.
Rising to his feet, incapacitated, puking violently, charging straight for me.
With his mouth opened wide drooling intensely, I leapt the fence and ran inside.
In the house I hide, barricading everything, what would come next?
Terrified, running up the stairs, finally found the shotgun kept under my bed.
It's time to put an end to this nightmare; I'll end your life as quickly as I chose to save it.
Removing the Debris only to see, the starving man behind me, as he pounced I never had a chance.
He bit my hand, he fucking bit me, and it's over for you swiftly placed the shotgun, to his head.

On the houses through the trees,
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall,
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawL

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow Little room,
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom.
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me.

&gt;From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death,
There are Patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath.
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies,
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies.

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell,
And it's fitting that it should,
For in darknesss I must dwell.
Like the color of my skin,
Or the day that I grow old,
My life is made of Patterns

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

And kill that man who gave me that awful name

And I just hit town and my throat was dry

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, ""My name is Sue! How do you do?
Now you're gonna die""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him curse
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view

We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and some swishers too
So we can roll a fat blunt and get perved

Another fine day in this land I live
Oakland where they don't give a shit and that's it
You know I'm sellin dank and split the profit 50/50
With this other brother who went in half with me
Now, first before we burst the move
We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor
Then we don't bicker
We'll be relaxed ask your mama
This shit is like a war zone
Streets is hot like the Bahamas
But we will stay away from the drama
I'm wearin' my snipe, my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama
But then we had to pause like a comma
Cause someone got stuck and bucked and family was outside with trauma
We heard the shots from inside and whenever gats go off
I hit the deck and hide
And if po-po said they got there on time they lied
But you gotta give them credit they try
I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why
And my man said fuck it ain't nothin' we can do
But to continue our mission down the block for the brew
And we out (yeah, yeah)

On our way we 'bout half way there
Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care
The Muslim Bakery is like right between
And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean
So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now
Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud
The ambulances signals and glances
So let's hurry up and don't take no chances
Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
In front of the store trying to work that sleight of hand
The panhandlers, they not no amateurs
Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up
It sums up life along with the kids and a wife
But anyway, we pass the local grocery store
And you can be sure the meats and the produce ain't good no more
Some of it is from days before
I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
They doin me in my community - fuck it, we there
Ain't enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
A nice little stroll through the April spring air
We hide our shit so the Nation don't see it there

She sits listening to the radio
And things--they ain't worked out
exactly as planned
But then, Southern California
ain't no place to make a stand...

You have to get up on your dancing feet
You will have no time to eat

I observe and I learn
Today I have been reversed
And it seems to me now like I`m the
centre of the universe

People ask me if I am going insane
But I say it`s justthis missile in my vain
It comes on hard, there`s no stop no start
And it kicks so strong, the kick goes on
Over and over `til you can`t belong,
it`s an endless song
One, two, three, it goes on

Ooo Mental Beat

Your hero is a zero
And you`re just another weirdo
It comes on like a bomber, a long distance drummer

there is no protection

What are you? What are you?
What, what, what are you?
What are you? What are you stupid?

To be bad to be born but born to be bad
The best emcee the mic ever had
I always was famous but never a star
A Don Juan, Perignon, Antoine, bourgeois

I'm bad without the big fancy cars
And the Louis Vuitton to the Yves St. Laurent
The higher echelon and the body guards
Not like Prince and Michael I come up hard

I'm the king of the streets I never meet my match
Hanging out in the Fever with AJ Scratch
People see me in the movies and on TV
But when they see me in the streets see that's the real me

So, throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you wanna' rock a beat with the King of the Street
Say Yeah!

What are you? What are you stupid?

The King, The King
You know, you know, you know what I'm saying

Driving my car wearing my jewelry
You can fool the public but you can't fool me
Because you made a little album got a royalty check
But your friends don't give you no respect

Spending my money using my style
They wore my crown for a little while
They went all around the world thinking their all that
But when they saw me on the stage I took it right back

Cause I dress like a pimp and I work like a ho
And rappin' is the only life I know
I got respect on the street so wherever I go
And they only get respect when they doin' a show

Cause their young dumb try to get some
In the process forgot where they come from
But what they can't see while their running the game
Is that their friends and enemies are the same

Cause united we stand divided you fall
And I am love and love conquers all
I love to turn on the mic and rock the house
and come on everybody and help me turn it out

And just clap your hands to the beat y'all
And let's rock it with the king of the streets y'all
You know Melle Mel, you know I rock well
Say Yeah!

What, what, what, what
What, what, what are you stupid?

I'm here to take command
After I crush him I'm crushing his man
I'm gonna' gather his whole crew in a bunch
And give them all the Malachi crunch

And when I rock them for the people to see
I'm gonna kick down his door and rock his family
His girl, the nation, his whole generation
And I'll even give myself a rock sensation

Cause I never had a fight when I'm on the mic
I beat a bum like him up just the other night
When he opened his eyes all he could see
was the referee, the ceiling and me

My name is Melvin Glover, I love to be a lover
I'm bad and I'm blessed
I can always rock a sucker, sucker, sucker MC on the microphone
So just give me the mic and get up off my throne

What, what, what, what are you
What, what, what, what are you stupid?

I grew up in the city streets
With holes in my clothes bummy shoes on my feet
Sometimes when I was hungry there was nothing to eat
and other times in the winter there was no heat

We would all freeze it was ten degrees
I would see my mother bow to her knees
She cried then nod then prayed to God
That times for the kids wouldn't be so hard

But out on the streets a life was rougher
The dream of getting rich made a man tougher
Twenty might get you forty, forty might get you eighty
Eighty for a lady that's five foot shady

Staying in the gutter hanging with my brother
My pop's got so drunk he use to stutter
Beat up on my mother, for no reason why
And to this day I try not to get high

The streets got it good so I should warn you
There's a drug store setup right on the corner
Selling dope, smoke, smack and crack a lack a lack
The sess mess splif or the chunk chunky black

Temptation reached for my vein
But I didn't let drugs overcome my brain
Because drugs rule the body and mess with your head
And makes you part of the living dead

But I went to school and I learned too good
I learned to understand all that I could
Thought I could skip a letter from l to z
So I took to the streets for my college degree

My teachers were the hustlers, garbage and bums
My class was survival and school was the slums
Math was counting money large candy no doubt
And my homework was knocking sucker niggaz out

Gym was when I had to run from the cops
And history was who was on top
I would hear about the death of the neighborhood crooks
I didn't want to be in those history books

So I got myself legal as easy as pie
A legal crook got a suit and tie
Like a crooked politician selling dreams and lies
So he can rob you blind then tell you why

Get the most for less then pocket the rest
Kick backs, hit backs, invest your interest
Build a better bomb then raise the tax
You know the king would put the truth on wax

Because I'm the kind of king that'll open doors
Let me live my life and you live yours
Do what you wanna' do and don't hurt nobody
and come on everybody let's party that party

and throw your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
And everybody just freak with the King of the Street
Say Oh Yeah"

Look up and open your eyes
See everything you meant to be
Selling yourself short
When there's only so far you can see
Though your body is broken,
Your soul remains intact
Finding wholeness in the places that you lack
Look up and see who you are has become so clear
Hold on, for the dawn is drawing near
Clouds of depression are fading away

The Good And The Bad
(ted hawkins)

Living is good when you have someone to share it with
Laughter is bad when there is no one there to share it with
Talking is sad if you've got no one to talk to
Dying is good when the one you love grows tired of you

Sugar is no good once it's cast among the white sand
What's the point in pulling the
gray hairs from among the black strands?
When you're old you shouldn't walk in the fast lane
Oh, ain't it useless to keep trying to draw true love from that man

He'll hurt you, yes just for the sake of hurting you
And he'll hate you if you try to love him just the same
He'll use you and everything you have to offer him
On your way girl
Get out and find you someone new"

Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere

I remember a girl so very well
The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell
O where do we go now but nowhere

In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun
And then we fucked it down again
Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down
Going round and round to nowhere

The kitten that padded and purred on my lap
Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that
O where do we go now but nowhere

O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up

Across clinical benches with nothing to talk
Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer
While the bones of our child crumble like chalk
O where do we go now but nowhere

I remember a girl so bold and so bright
Loose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare
Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light
O where do we go now but nowhere

You come for me now with a cake that you've made
Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades
O where do we go now but nowhere

O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up

If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home
From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air
Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans
O where do we go now but nowhere

Around the duck pond we grimly mope
Gloomily and mournfully we go rounds again
And one more doomed time and without much hope
Going round and around to nowhere

From the balcony we watched the carnival band
The crack of the drum a little child did scare
I can still feel his tiny fingers pressed in my hand
O where do we go now but nowhere

If I could relive one day of my life
If I could relive just a single one
You on the balcony, my future wife
O who could have known, but no one

O wake up, my love, my lover make up
O wake up, my love, my lover make up"

Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
And then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service

A good man you were to me, always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me
Didn't matter, what, when, or where
You were there

I never thought we'd part
From the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted some attention
And I'm sorry baby for bitchin'

If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

You never know what you have till it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one

There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one

All of the good times we had together
Do they mean something to you
Do you ever wish we never split
'Cause I still got love for you

Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one

There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said I love you

WE BLAME LOVE



It couldn't be clearer
I'll apologise right now
In spectacular language
I think you'll understand somehow
If I need to reach you
We've got to walk a path where love's forgotten 

(Love) Diamond skin and clear blue eyes that never see
(Love) Every past needs broken time
Remind me how it used to be
(We blame Love) Heart is beating, mind is thinking
Body's moving
(We blame Love) Don't say another thing
It's dangerous it's deadly just like... 

The secret is out
Beyond belief eternally
Naked and recognised
You see I'm just a boy who can't say... 

(Love) Is the purest energy
In my philosophy
(Love) Every past needs broken time
Remind me how it used to be 

(We blame Love) Fascination, strange attraction
Chain reaction
(We blame Love) For we are wild for truth
It's dangerous it's deadly just like... 

It's just a clever trick
I know, bewitching me
But seeing you clouds my eyes
And if it rains then let it rain on me 

(Love) Diamond skin and clear blue eyes that never see
(Love) Every past needs broken time
Remind me how it used to be 

(We blame Love) Heart is beating, mind is thinking

It's dangerous it's deadly just like...

The saving of your life
A million times a second
The father of invention 

Remind me how it used to be

Chain reaction
(We blame Love) Oh let it rain on me
It's dangerous it's deadly just like... 

She's a real space slipper in an
Atomic graveyard she's got
Personal radar she is
Face to face electronically with
Me. I'm a living specimen
A single wing of a broken bird cries
Love
We're safe here in the past
Don't say another thing
I can't just pretend
The memory has left me
Your cold hand warm against my skin
A misinterpretation of tears
A freaky kind of nature
The world's gone mad - and I have"

Every record that he touches, turns to gold
He's well conducted, self-instructed
His style's worthwhile, Heavenly constructed

Mechanically inclined, and if you don't mind
He adds spice to your life time after time
I think it's 'bout time, to heed the long lecture

And how was it made?
Who died in the process
And who got paid a starvation wage? Shopcops protect
A terrifying place
Willing to serve you 24 hours a day
Slick etiquettes
A great masquerade
Fluorescent tubes illuminate milelong aisles
Aseptic floors
Colorful shelves: myriads of products, but all their content is the same
Fooled and deceived
Who made us fall for this sham?
Who made us swallow the bait that we need all that shit?
Place your blind faith
In every produce
Don't hesitate or enquire, just follow our rules
No one complains
Customer is king
Why would you bother, just enter the pin
Who made us fall
Fall for the myth
That we would be better off with everything at our fingertips?
No one realized
How somewhere along the line
We have surrendered to the great void in our lives
Overwhelmed by the immense selection
Exerted to cover our inanition
Afraid that there's something that we could be missing
We'd pay any price to buy everything
We stand in line and smile... Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives
Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives
Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives
Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives"

Well I came at you a young boy, girl
With no experience.
Year in year out
We had our ups and downs
But I always took it serious.
I made a joke
I played the fool
I took time, made all the plans.
I know I told you that we were
Supposed to have something
Made for this weekend
But I changed my mind.
I changed my mind.
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
And I changed my mind
Well it started getting cozy, girl
I let you control the reins.
And despite what I knew to be true
I'd hoped that things would change.
I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.
But I just let it whiz on by.
People say ""L-B it's goin awry!""
And I'd flip up say ""that's not right.""
Now I see my shit's not tight.
Now I changed my mind
[CHORUS]
Well lookin back now
I was a young man, girl.
In hindsight I regret.
I never listen to my better judgement
So my blind side got the best of me.
But we live and learn.

What you did in turn
Made me never have to settle for less.
And would I deserve and once you mature girl
You'll always be second best.
[CHORUS]
I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.
But I just let it whiz on by.
People say ""L-B it's goin awry!""
And I'd flip up say ""that's not right.""
Now I see my shit's not tight.
It really pains me to say things change
But your limitations would've held me back.
The things you say try to underrate me
They were just a reflection of your self-respect.
But now I let it whiz on by.
You can't tell me LB can't fly!
Kiss my wings, you can't hypnotize me!
Hear the M-singer singin this bye-bye.
I changed my mind bout this here relationship
That you've become so complacent with.
I've changed my mind.
You've sacrificed everything we had
For a happenin' price.
Changed my mind, plain and simple
Now tame and gentle
Changed my mind, i tried
I kept it quiet now why the hell
Ya wanna go and advertise?"

But I don't recall a lot about the movie stars
Mostly that old Chevrolet and you
They don't make cars like they used to
I wish we still had it today
The love we first tasted, the good love we're still living
We owe it to that old '57 Chevrolet
Remember when we used to park it in the lane
And listen to the country radio
We'd hold on to each other while the singer sang
And we'd stay like that 'til it was time to go
Now it makes me sad to think the good old days are gone
Although our love is still as strong today
But the world would have a lot more lovers hanging on
If they still made '57 Chevrolets
They don't make cars like they used to

(banjo intro)

In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two-three, with a-one-two-three)

We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood by our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)

We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

TRBDCAH128EF362D31.h5,The Pharcyde,Passin' Me By,1993,"Now in my younger days I used to sport as sag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag,
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss.
Always got mad when the class was dismissed,
But when it was in session, I always had a question.
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much,
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug.
She was married to the man. He was a thug, his name was Lee, he drove a Z,
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock.
I was on her jock, yes indeedy. I wrote graffiti on the bus.
First I'd write her name then carve a plus,
With my name last, on the looking glass,
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass.

She keeps on passing me by...
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly.
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me,
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better,
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter.
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her,
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture.
I'm shootin' for her heart, got my finger on the trigger.
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigger,
But all I can do is stare.
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare.
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated, not at all over-rated.
I think I need a prayer,
To get in her book and it looks rather dry,
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye.
Although she's crazy steppin' I'll try to stop her stride,
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by.

And I must voice my opinion of not even pretending she didn't have me.
Strung like a chicken, chase my tail like a doggie,
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan.
Dude, she looked good, down side: she had a man.
He was a rudey, too, a nincompoop.
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop.
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand,
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man.

She keeps on passing me by...
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian,
And now the world around me be gets movin' in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by. Why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, i did not really pursue my little princess with persistance;
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired, secretly admired her;
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went:
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well.
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you.
When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I symp.
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp!
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so,
And if I was your man then I would be true.
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you.
Give a try and consider the one who loves you dearly,
P.S. Love me tender.'
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender.
Damn!

She keeps on passing me by."

If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race?
When the Fords and the Lincolns were settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
'Cause I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders, and use them all
Got overdrive, just won't stall

With four barrel carbs and a dual exhaust
With four-eleven gears you can really get lost
Got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

We pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We was drivin' up on Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they were standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me""
By then the tail light was all you could see

Now the fellas all ribbed me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Well I wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I'd hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is, there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down, I see spots
The lines on the road just look like dots""

We took a corner, sideswiped a truck
And  I crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
And the guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Even feel the tension, man, what a ride
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
Down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in the mirror, red light was blinkin'
The cops were after my Hot Rod Lincoln

Well, they arrested me and they put me in jail
They called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin'

What the fuck is mine my nigga I'll take it
Grab a player hater by the neck

And since you haters ain't got no business
That's how we attack your shit

Everybody still playing that hood game quiet
(Quiet, quiet)
Especially when it's tired
My environment ain't nothing but niggaz dying

In a chemical fed injection in Jasper, Texas
Split up these niggaz off in different sections
Don't hate my message
Destiny led to mimic chastity for my daughter

Wad up a niggaz sherm and come listen to the sermon
Swerving in my suburban lick it up with the bottle
But everybody know I got some problems
Had dreams of the Apollo

The fiends had faith in me
Suckas wouldn't run, a nigga not insane
Niggaz still with me bone, some how they turn up
Run up and get your sign run blindly
Elevate through time nowhere to hide

You know what you should've capped like 2-Pac with a glock
They're deadly better not upset my thug mentality sucka

You know you done fucked up don't you niggaz
Runnin' up blastin' big ass triggers
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky
Could it be a bird or maybe it's even a plane

For the untamed insane human only the fifth dog
Fuck you thought mothafuck fame
For the fact the shit is a fat game going
Remain number one in the land

Flesh strangle the gang
Bang bang bang I dropped five guards
In the name of the Lord I say
Now how many times will I have to slay today
Will I raise my guage, oh God

How will I teach ya, but it's these tactics that he daily practice
They gonna let you, don't have it have it
Runnin' up you sons of bastards blast it
We sons of assassins match it collecting more cash

That's true your feeling that
Niggaz said all my babies get a million
Struggle with a villain hit them with a venomous blow
I call on my mighty, y'all can joke

Gonna surround my soul but go with the calico yo
We the tightest you know Mo the Mighty
Yes trues humbly united, my family never divided
Desperado, Thug Line, Mo Thug, Millennium, 7th Sign

For the FBI you wanna come test my enterprise
Bitch you better go think twice and open up your mothafuckin' eyes
These niggaz can't fuck with the fifth dog finna parlay
Everyday stormin' your way you better lay low

So you might just duck when I buck guage
Can't you see my niggaz having a ball all day
Since we having a ball all day mothafuckers player hate

My world is made of blue skies and sunshine
Green fields and butterflies
I’m so glad I’m a country girl

Birds sing good morning to a country girl
And I sleep to the sounds of whip-o-wills
My day is made with puppies and kittens meadows and daisies
I’m so glad I’m a country girl

Running over hills playing in the woods free breezes blowing
Honey bees are swarming, black birds are flying, wonder where they’re going
Picking stick-me-tights off my gingham dress darkness is falling
Firewood to carry eggs to gather and supper’s ready mamma’s calling

At the age of twenty-two

They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei

She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried ""The stink of human sin
Is more that I can bear""

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball

She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl

Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meusse and swim away

I never had to study math, science or history,
I'd have a chemical flashback to jog my memory.
In my junior year I swore I loved sweet Miss Sherrie-Ann,
One night I put some everclear in her Dr. Pepper can.
I thought it'd make her easy, but she took it pretty hard,
I took her home and rang her doorbell, left her lyin' in the yard.

Its the invisible intoxicant... its called everclear.

I remember my church picnic in the spring of '89,
They had 4 fresh watermelon sliced right off the vine.
When they bowed their heads giving grace for the food,
Hey, I pulled out the bottle, and I soaked them melons good.
Well they never knew what hit 'em, when the potion went to work,
They had Grandma's doin' backflips, Grandpa's lookin' up their skirts.
They were singing Hallelujah and Willie Nelson songs,
Preacher said it was the best dang picnic,
That the baptists had ever thrown.

Tequila dries me out, and beer just makes me fat.
Whiskey makes me nauseous, tell me who the hell needs that?
If you're thinkin' about drinkin', then the answer's crystal clear,
Its the invisible intoxicant... its called everclear.

When I'm drinkin' everclear, I think I'm king of this whole world,
I'm bigger and badder than John Wayne and cooler than Steve Earle.
Until I wake up and I'm face down in the hall, 
Hey, I'm completely naked, for a reason I can't recall.
Well I'm kinda, sorta thinkin' that maybe I met a chick,
'Cause there's perfume in the air, and there's lipstick on my neck.
Well I hope that she was pretty and I hope that she was kind,
Enough to leave my clothes somewhere they're easy to find.

You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction, what, the main feature
And I'mma greet ya, like a rhyming ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brother well prepared is the brother who will start
And that's me Akki, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
Cause that happens to be the nature of man
Sexuality, it is the format baby
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes
But I praise the Lord of the worlds that's unseen
Respect me for that and let me do my thing

My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MC's resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncing my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your egos on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your clique
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not Dick

Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit

And I'mma make it happen for my whole outfit

Got the beauty of a flower plus dimensions like a prism

Y'all really need to go lay down cause positivity has risen
We hitting, yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time, we ain't joking
For security, yo we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doing the hustle and you backstage vogueing
We all got faults, don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings, there's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme, damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel but next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight that we don't need
We slim with disabilities and thick with possibilities
Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigating with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
And strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still ring bells
There ain't no plan B's, yo watch, we moving through with plan A
Money market doing things the right way

You know we gotta get a hold

Dreams of getting well
Spells of Esmeralda
Amarose foretold

Bones are never asked
Where are we going to
It was never up to me
And yet I pushed until it broke

And all that it suggests
Wheel wagon dust
Weeds and infidelities
And always swore our love
Never questioned why
In a wooden house
Immovable and silent
And drinking strawberry wine
Forever lost in town

And through the sleeping streets
Night bound and heavy
Wheels in a spoke
Just a spoken foreign sound

Know my gates are high
My friends even higher
Forgotten in my mind
Yet the scars still lingering
Cloud the blue skies
I'm jealous of you birds

In a world full of words

Hear the prairie sound
In a friend called near
The heart is pointed down
But my spirit pointed up
His voice the siren
Of Greek mythology

I pause with my pen
I begin to defend
Every action taken
Every moment sealed
When I was quick
It coursed through open veins

The will to live
The urgency to move
Behind a panel door
Sealing cherry stain
I played my guitar
And lived those lonesome notes

Like a dog that's down
In a corner just aside
Waiting to be called
Waiting to be yours
Ghosts of a machine
Without purpose or will

I'll often speak of you
But the you was always me
'Cause when I speak of me
It's me I ask of you
So let there be no truth
Just trickery in rhymes
Time the only thing
Waiting still is death

I hope for resolution
Pray one defining moment
Pause without restraint
Barren without child
A child is who I was
A child is who I'll die

You see I don't like to remenisce about the past
The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth
Each and every wrong move the police keep count
make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out
I was at the funeral when it all began
You know the painful transition from a boy to men
I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine
didn't understand death nearly lost my mind
But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it
Age ten, new step family arrangement 
at thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick
And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit
I would forever be hit with anything in reach 
Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach
about forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked
Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked
physical contact was in form of a slap
at the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back
courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap
Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black
Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate
Into juvenile detention where I built up hate
I don't remember the date of the judical debate
but legally I was now in custody of the state

And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink
Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak
I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make
Gotta find some way to release this hate

Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief, pride is the chief cause and the decline
In the number of husbands and wives

A woman and a man, a man and a woman
Some can and some can't and some can

Two broken hearts, lonely, looking like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people, each having so much pride inside
Neither side forgives

All covered in blood
The moon and the stars
Where the troops that lay conquered
Like fruit left to wither
Poor spiritual food

And the spears of bright sun
All brave with it conquest
Did hover unearthly
In banners of fire
I kneit in the garden
Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes

Thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood

There'll be no sorrow
There'll be no road too narrow
There'll be a new day
And it's today

Through the back entrance and up to the round;
Then by some magic his bent body straightened,
I can make it from here now, I know where I am.

Thanks for the hand but now I can stand I'll walk on alone;
The voices and faces I know them all well now,
I can hear, I can see don't worry 'bout me, I'm finally home.

When burdens were heavy, when days were too long;
When there was a part for an old gospel singer,
When folks needed hope I'd sing them my song.

One of these days someone will lead me,
Through Heaven's stage door and into the wing;
There'll be a place in that final performance,
I know my part and I'm ready to sing.

Back on subject, son was wilding, staying up with some beef
Some cats ran up in his spot, started dumping the heat
So did they kill him? No he lived but shot Steve, Sally, and Jason
Word? His wife and kids? Yeah, got him set on retaliation
Started freebasing, got lifted, then turned homicidal
Grabbed his rifle, started rehearsing verses from out the Bible
Ran outside, started bucking, hit some kid on a bike
The law caught up with him, the judge threw him in prison for life
Legal suicide

I heard they gave him two life sentences, shit is crazy man but I guess some cats can't take the pain. You gotta play with the cards dealt. Looks like Michael got a fucked up hand.

Boom boom boom, six o'clock on the dot, still no light
Something don't feel right, he's gonna start a fight
So he can go to the hole, he can't take it no more
He's lost control, penitentiaries blackened the soul
He was beefing with the Aryans
They said he couldn't wear the skin of a white man
Chilling with black barbarians
But that's how it was in the area he came up
He trusted no human being,?
Throughout the struggle and strife he hustled up a pipe
Filed it down sharp so it would function as a knife
Wore his shirt loose so he could stuff it in his side
To puncture a windpipe, he never been nice
He stabbed a man in the heart to see the pain he felt
And then he had plans to go and hang himself
But before he tied the sheet to the top of the bed
He was stabbed six times in the stomach and once in the neck
A poetic death"

[Xzibit]
Yeah..
Addicted to life, had to pay a heavy-ass price
Sacrifice worth waitin on the platinum and ice
I'm precise with the merchandise, came back like Christ
to change the game, while y'all niggaz remain the same
Clear the lane, comin through like Kobe, you can't hold me
You can't stop me, ever since I dropped ""Paparazzi""
I done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit
Like every idiot that can spit be droppin a hit
I transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted
Shadowbox, detox, my own worse critic
It's like tryin to squeeze water from rocks
I negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a glock
Sick of niggaz screamin they hot, but really they not
Beatin you all to the ground like six L.A. cops
Put your fist up in the air if you ever been shot
and lived to tell about it, never leavin home without it, c'mon

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
There's no one out there, for us, to fear
I'll say it loud and clear..
Who can say they're close, to us
Speak now and you'll be brought, to tears

[King Tee]
They probably saw me on the 91 East, gettin off on Central
with the rag back, lookin like life's so simple
Tela take a loss, still floss, all bets
If Trife can't cover the house, call X
Likwit crew brothers, Blues Brothers
Move somethin, make killers do somethin, f'real
The bitch-made often politic with the skill
Now shit's all twisted, unlisted
Guns fixed it, best not speak about the Likwit
We gifted, twenty-four hours and still lifted
(*X*: Bitch keep your vagina) We drunk and ain't interested
Bitches come a dime and a dove, we ain't trippin it
Standin at the bar, soft-styled in the cut
""Ooh, boo wait, I think you had too much!""
Bitch what?  Act right and pour it in a cup
The West and Eastside keep smokin them blunts, niggaz

[Interlude: Butch Cassidy]
Let's get with it, I was born to trip
Stay on the lookout, ain't no time to slip
We ain't for games and shit
Change your spot, cause we're known to dip
No time for chasin hoes
I'm on a mission cause my cash is low
There's no need to speak on those
Doggy rags are the gangsta's clothes

[Defari]
There's two sides of my family, both sides from the ghetto
Pops Finnish choco-late, moms Mississippi yellow
Caramel, Cherokee black man, with a pedigree of excellence
Together we rise, no time for seperateness
My grandfather Snake was a Jake, or a jack
of a smack to a bird who don't know how to act
Straight hustler, Mississippi moonshine smuggler
Good ol' wrangler in his day with that attitude of ""Fuck ya""

[Xzibit]
Built to run forever, X the infinite
First line of defense to smash through the immigrants
Can't straddle the fence, it's all or nothin
Close the curtain, shut down your whole production
Don't be scared, be prepared, niggaz do be bustin
without thinkin; I mastered the art of hard drinkin
Yo, you wanna stop the X, try your best
I'm still fuckin with your pockets like the IRS, so yo

[Chorus]

[Butch Cassidy]
Gather all around, to see
how we display our vicious skills
I done seen and heard, enough
Let's prove the West coast is for real

I do not need you. Nor do I listen to the words you say.
Strongly I heed you. But ev'ry promise seems to fade away.
Who is the clown that walks in the steps of my shadow?
Is it the man who does what he can but never does it right?

How can I prove? There is no reasoning or asking why.
Only to prove. I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes.

Next I wished for wealth, 90 million in the bank account
Young niggaz with money, that's somethin' we need to think about

'Cause we could be the President, we could be the Senators
Right now niggaz think we just drug dealers and janitors
We big, that's big, we large, in charge

With the three level seats for when it's time to scoop my group

I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic
Now I know that it's stone cold funk, I can tell
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell
That funk the aroma, that smell, that scent
You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent
Your odor going 'round, doin' people bodily harm
And then somebody turned around and said

(I smell your underarms)

You woke up late for work usin' the same old line
Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time
The more you ignore, the worse the smell grows
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose
It was the rush hour when I was on the train
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death
I couldn't hold a conversation, I was holding my breath
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air
Was homeboy sittin' next to me, I swear!
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming
(ugh...)

(I smell your underarms)

Hanging at a party one night, all alone
Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon
The crowd was on the floor, rocking the beat
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week
The smell was all through the house, cold rockin' the place
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm
A girl said ""Look, there's Monster growin under his arm""
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh)
And they declared his arm public enemy number one
Now throw your hands in the air, if you want to party hard
Now put your hands back down, everybody's,'cause
You didn't use Right Guard

She turned and I was gone

TRBGXHJ128F93302C7.h5,FFH,Listen,2005,"Voices are everywhere, and they’re screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me. We’ve got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times. You can’t do it. You can’t do it on your own. You’re not smart enough. You’re not strong enough. You’re not stable enough. You’re not thin enough. And then there’s the enemy. The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you’ll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago. He’s a great man. I love him so much. And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him. My dad had just put a room onto his house. And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad’s work. And he got done and went to my dad, and said, “That’s a good job Harry.” And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice. Without hearing that, whether it’s the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don’t have any identity. You have no way to function. I think Jesus knew that. I think that’s why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people. He never asked them to be anything that they weren’t. He tried to get them to understand who they were. That’s why he said, “You’re my daughter, you’re my son, you’re my brother, you’re my sheep.” He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we’re His creation; that we're worth something.

Yeah, and that’s something amazing about Jesus. He could look down into somebody’s spirit and draw out who they really were. I mean, he looked at Simon and said, “You know what? You’re not Simon, You’re Peter. You’re a Rock.”

And how ‘bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, “Daughter.” His first word: Daughter.

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father. Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke. I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn’t inward. Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it. Like at His baptism, God the father said, “you are my son, I love you and I’m pleased with you.” And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it. The father said, “You are my son. I have chosen you, and God just established Christ’s purpose on that mountain.” And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour? No. This is why I’ve come. Glorify your name father. And the father spoke and said, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross.

I think it did too. You may have never heard that voice. That voice that says you’re worth it. You’re smart enough. I believe in you. I love you. There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it’s just a vacuum. Listen, Jesus doesn’t require anything of you. You can’t work to get His approval. Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, “This is my son who I love.” Jesus hadn’t done a single miracle. All he asks of you is that you listen."

Pass the Uzi, to blow up, any wack MC that show up,
there goes one, blast 'im now.
[E, hold up.]
*Don't make me wait-wait* because it might be too late, the punk might escape,
and buck whyle, and in fact, bite my style, and I'm-a catch a bullshit charge,
plus trial.
It's my thing to swing, your first mistake to bring a duck MC that can't hang.
Don't forget, I'm crazy swift. My name is Erick Sermon
[yeah, and I'm Parrish Smith]

Parrish:
My life story I tell straight from the heart.
When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start.
A young black kid destined for success, no Old Gold, no cocaine, or buddha cess.
Straight up hard work. No sleep and no shorts.
Brainstormin' with the skills that Pop Duke taught.
To keep swingin', yeah, and not to quit.
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick, with your punk friends,
straight up pussy from Punk City, my attitude's fucked up and real shitty.
From the backstabbers, yeah my so-called friends,
who swim in my pool. When it's time, flex the Benz,
around town, windows down at the South Town, Cool J tape or K-Solo ""Spellbound""
With fly girlies dippin, brothers grippin' and sippin'
Old Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and
I'm just lampin' with my EK shades, truck-jewels, obviously the man's paid.
But of course not, brother can't get his props
like for instance, when I cruise up the block
in my 560 lampin' on my Metro phone, chrome kit beamin' all off your dome.
But like a sucka, yeah, you looked the other way
That's how I knew you're on my dick kid, but it's okay.
It's normal, relax, your whole head's busted.
Caught in the rap skit, ya couldn't be trusted.
Cuz my sounds pound from here to Okinowi...{kiss} peace and I'm ouuuutie!

Refrain

Erick:
Stay tuned to this last episode, when I rock the house and the mic explodes.
This is not the buckwild style that I be usin', in fact black,
it causes {mass confusion}
It's a fallout, when sucker MCs and crowds call out my name,
oh what a shame I got {fame!}
Parrish:
I'm not a new jack, my rhymes are not wack, and in fact,
I'm like Clint Eastwood, 'stead of bullets, rhymes I pack
in my flow gun, so son, ya better run,
cuz when it comes to hostage and prisoners, we take none.
We move wax like kilos ...{scratch}
and when my jam hits the streets, the sounds explode.
Watch the right hook, duck the death blow jack,
I wonder where the E and the P's at...
[Can they do it again?] You bet your ass, black.

Buenas tardes, adelante

Durante toda su vida

Y que hoy esta a punto de abrir esa puerta
La puerta de esa jaula

Cuentame que te pasa

Ella vive conmigo en mi inconsciente
Ella es dueÃ±a de mi pasado y mi presente
Su morada es mi falta de seguridad
Y su comida mi ansiedad

Ella pisa cada uno de mis pasos
Bebe el vino junto a mi y del mismo vaso
Ella es la mujer perfecta que me construyo mama

Sera doctor
Que el chaleco de fuerza
Aun sigue atando mi cordura
Que mis complejos aun no razgan su costura
O sera que la mujer que me construyo mama
Es de muy grande de estatura

Sera doctor
Que pido mucho o que me conformo con poco
Que sigo cuerdo o estoy totalmente loco
O sera que la vida no es otra cosa
Que un racimo de antojos
Y la que paga los platos rotos, siempre es ella

La de a deveras
La que me cuida
La que me entibia en mis noches de tanto frio
La que me espera
La que me aguanta

And know why I lurk the streets

Burning in hell, but don't deserved to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
It's because they heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be poppin, robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it

Play around in dirt, you get mugged
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns to mudred and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky

I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate
But then it's out of state, and it's too late
For change is to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy. For real

Drawn from faded scripture, to teach me what to see:
A world where we're all helpless sinners,
Damned in weakness to slavery.
I voted in, gave up my eyes, drew in the shining myths,
The selfless deeds, the battle cries, the conquerors, the kings.
And so I drowned into a land, and watched my blunted teeth dissolve.
The sweet acidic resignation, damned to breathe obedience.

Dig deep!

I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them

What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane

Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&amp;R's lookin' like ""pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

With just another white trash county
kiss in '61.
Long brown hair and foolish eyes.
He'd look just like you'd want him to

Some kind of slick chrome American
prince.
A Blue Jean serenade

Moon River, what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you.
Saw Cinderella in a party dress,
But she was looking for a nightgown.
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands,
He's getting ready for the showdown.

I saw the minute that I turned away,
I got my money on a pawn tonight.
A change came in disguise of
revelation, set his soul on fire.
She said she always knew he'd come

around.
And the decades disappear
Like sinking ships but we persevere.

God gives us hope, but we still fear
what we don't know.
Your mind is poisoned.
Castles in the sky sit stranded,
vandalized.
The drawbridge is closing.
Saw Cinderella in a party dress,
But she was looking for a nightgown.
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands,
He's getting ready for the showdown.
I saw the ending when they turned the
page,
I threw my money and I ran away.
Straight to the valley of the great
divide
Out where the dreams all hide.

Out where the wind don't blow,
Out here the good girls die.
And the sky won't snow
Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the good girls die
Now Cinderella, don't you go to
sleep?
It's such a bitter form of refuge.
Why don't you know the kingdom's
under siege
And everybody needs you.
Is there still magic in the midnight
sun,
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes.
Out where the dreams all hide"

And standing at the manger
He saw with his own eyes
The message from the angel come to life
And Joseph said

Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade
Why Him, with all the rulers in the world
Why here inside this stable filled with hay
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl
Now I'm not one to second guess what angels have to say
But this is such a strange way to save the world

To think of how it could have been
If Jesus had come as He deserved
There would have been no Bethlehem
No lowly shepherds at His birth
But Joseph knew the reason
Love had to reach so far
And as he held the Savior in his arms
He must have thought

Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade
Why Him, with all the rulers in the world
Why here inside this stable filled with hay
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl
Now I'm not one to second guess what angels have to say

Searching in the shadows
Looking for the light
Running through the night
Searching in the shadows
Going for the light
Standing in the darkness

Caught in the act now you watch my back
Cant tell a lie Im afraid to die
